    "title": "Sounding and Writing a Nepali Public Sphere: The Music and Language of Jhy\u0101ure",
    "content": "# Sounding and Writing a Nepali Public Sphere: The Music and Language of Jhy\u0101ure\n**Citation:** Stirr, Anna. \"Sounding and Writing a Nepali Public Sphere: The Music and Language of Jhy\u0101ure.\" *Asian Music* 46, no. 1 (2015): 3-38.\n\n## Core Argument &amp; Scope\nThe article examines how the interaction between oral/aural and written aspects of language and song has shaped the modern Nepali-language public sphere. Stirr traces the history of the jhy\u0101ure musical and poetic genre from the early nineteenth century to the present, focusing on how its demotic values and regional hybridity contributed to an idea of Nepali national public space and cultural unification [1-3].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author utilizes Habermas\u2019s concept of the \"public sphere\" of communicative action to describe creators shaping public space [4]. She draws on Lisa Gitelman\u2019s \"relations of textuality\" to show how print and non-print media evolve together inextricably [5, 6]. Additionally, she employs Francesca Orsini\u2019s concept of the \"customary\" to define cultural practices that bridge the public and private spheres [7, 8].\n* **Key Terms:** Jhy\u0101ure is a polysemic term denoting various song genres, poetic meters, and a specific 6-beat musical rhythm [9]. Madal is a two-headed barrel drum commonly used to accompany jhy\u0101ure performances [9]. Thego refers to a word, phrase, or set of vocables inserted into a line of poetry as a refrain [10]. Lok or lokgit refers to the broad category of Nepali folk poetry and song that emphasizes sounded language [11, 12].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The article discusses Asare Jhy\u0101ure (rice-planting songs), Thado Bhaka, Salaijo (or Baglunge Jhy\u0101ure), and Lahari Sahitya (erotic printed poetry) [13-17]. It also mentions Muna Madan, a famous episodic love poem written in jhy\u0101ure meter [18, 19].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Instruments analyzed include the madal (barrel drum), khaijad\u012b (frame drum), b\u0101nsur\u012b (flute), and the 4-stringed Nepali s\u0101rang\u012b [20].\n* **Musical Structure:** The discussion focuses on the 6-beat musical tal known as jhy\u0101ure tal, which can be divided into groups of two and three to create rhythmic tension [9, 21, 22]. The poetic meter is syllabic rather than durational, with Asare Jhy\u0101ure typically divided into groups of 5, 5, and 6 syllables [23, 24].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author\u2019s research is grounded in a fifteen-year relationship with the music of central and western Nepal, including two years of full-time ethnographic fieldwork [25, 26]. Evidence includes field interviews with musicians and politicians, textual analysis of 19th-century \"pulp fiction\" (lahari), and study of archival recordings and literary works [25, 27, 28]."

    "content": "# Culture as Freedom: Musical \u201cLiberation\u201d in Batticaloa, Sri Lanka\n**Citation:** Sykes, Jim. \"Culture as Freedom: Musical \u201cLiberation\u201d in Batticaloa, Sri Lanka.\" *Ethnomusicology* 57, no. 3 (2013): 485-517.\n\n## Core Argument &amp; Scope\nThe article explores musical actions aimed at achieving psychological and physical liberation from modern political oppression and communal discourses promoted by the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE. Sykes focuses on Batticaloan musicians who utilize an alternative history of shared ethnic interaction to disrupt ethnonationalist ideologies of cultural purity [29-31].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author uses Jacques Ranciere\u2019s concept of \"dissensus\" to describe acts that disrupt naturalized social hierarchies [32]. He applies Aihwa Ong\u2019s \"graduated sovereignty\" to explain how states control populations through differential regulation based on cultural difference [33]. He also utilizes James C. Scott\u2019s \"non-state space\" to characterize regions with ambiguous relations to sovereign powers [32].\n* **Key Terms:** Kooththu is a revered form of Sri Lankan Tamil musical theater performed in front of Hindu temples [34]. Annaviyar is the director of a kooththu who plays the maththalam drum and leads the performance [34]. Vattakalari refers to the theatre-in-the-round space where traditional temple dramas occur [34]. Sarala gi is a style of pan-Sri Lankan popular \"light music\" that historically involved interaction between different ethnic groups [35].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Discussion includes the kooththu styles of tenmodi and vadamodi, the Sinhala nadagam (dramatic form), sarala gi (light music), and baila (Afro-Portuguese-derived dance music) [35-37].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Instruments analyzed include the maththalam (drum), parai (low-caste frame drum), mridangam, thavil, and the Sinhala drums gata bera, yak bera, davula, and tamm\u00e4ttama [34, 38-41].\n* **Musical Structure:** The author notes that maththalam drumming uses language-like phrasing (pada) and avoids being fit into strict North Indian or Carnatic beat-cycles (tala) [42, 43]. He highlights structural similarities between Batticaloan Tamil and Sinhala berava drumming in terms of raised drum rims and heavy hand strokes [43].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nInformation was gathered through several stints of fieldwork conducted between 2004 and 2008 with Sinhala Buddhist, Tamil, and Muslim musicians in regions divided by the civil war [44, 45]. Evidence includes biographical vignettes of musicians, analysis of drum construction, and historical study of theatrical revivals [29, 38, 46]."

    "title": "Meaningful Adjustments: Musical Performance and Ritual Action in a South Indian Temple",
    "content": "# Meaningful Adjustments: Musical Performance and Ritual Action in a South Indian Temple\n**Citation:** Tallotte, William. \"Meaningful Adjustments: Musical Performance and Ritual Action in a South Indian Temple.\" *Analytical Approaches to World Music* 4, no. 1 (2015): 1-22.\n\n## Core Argument &amp; Scope\nThe article explores the temporal and structural relationship between the periya m\u0113\u1e37am ensemble and ritual action during daily worship in the \u015aaiva temple of Chidambaram. Tallotte argues that musicians must adjust the duration of fixed repertoire to match flexible ritual sequences by utilizing implicit cognitive schemas and performative principles [47-49].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The study utilizes cognitive anthropology, specifically the concepts of \"schemas\" and \"cultural models,\" to describe mental frameworks that allow for shortcuts in musical action [50, 51]. It also references Pierre Bourdieu\u2019s \"habitus\" to explain embodied routines learned through experience rather than linguistic mediation [52, 53].\n* **Key Terms:** Periya m\u0113\u1e37am is a \"large orchestra\" typically composed of two n\u0101gasvaram shawms and two tavil barrel-drums used in high-caste Hindu temple worship [54]. P\u016bj\u0101 refers to public daily rituals performed in honor of the presiding deity [55, 56]. Ke\u1e6d\u1e6di m\u0113\u1e37am is a short instrumental tumult intended to emphasize crucial moments when worshippers receive a vision of the deity [57].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The central focus is on the mall\u0101ri repertoire, specifically the T\u0113r mall\u0101ri (mall\u0101ri of the chariot), which is unique to the periya m\u0113\u1e37am [58]. It also mentions the k\u012brtta\u1e49ai genre [59].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Instruments analyzed are the n\u0101gasvaram (double-reed shawm), tavil and madda\u1e37am (barrel-drums), and t\u0101\u1e37am or j\u0101lr\u0101 (cymbals) [54, 56, 60].\n* **Musical Structure:** The music is played in r\u0101ga Gambh\u012bra-n\u0101\u1e6da, based on a pentatonic scale [58]. Rhythms involve quintuple subdivisions of the beat (kha\u1e47\u1e0da, 2+3), often associated with the five syllables of the mantra Nama\u1e25 \u015aiv\u0101ya [61]. The ritual itself follows a symmetrical, palindrome-like structure [62, 63].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author gathered information through interviews, observations, and audio recordings made between 2000 and 2010 at the Chidambaram Na\u1e6dar\u0101ja temple [47, 60]. The analysis involves comparing different performances of the same ritual piece across various days to track temporal adjustments [64, 65]."

Rajarattinam Pillai and Caste Rivalry in South Indian Classical Music.\" *Ethnomusicology* 44, no. 3 (2000): 460-490.\n\n## Core Argument &amp; Scope\nThe article examines the rivalry between Brahmans and Isai Ve\u1e37\u1e37\u0101lars in South Indian classical music through the heterogeneous interpretations of the n\u0101gasvaram master T. N. Rajarattinam Pillai. Terada argues that Pillai\u2019s charisma became a site where these two caste groups negotiated their musical traditions' identity and moral standing [66-68].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author uses Max Weber\u2019s concept of \"charisma\" to analyze Pillai\u2019s influence [69]. He employs Michel de Certeau\u2019s and Fredrik Barth\u2019s theories on group identity and \"social boundaries\" to show how Isai Ve\u1e37\u1e37\u0101lars are conceptualized as cultural \"others\" [70, 71]. He also draws on James C. Scott\u2019s \"hidden transcripts\" to describe symbolic resistance to Brahman hegemony [72, 73].\n* **Key Terms:** Isai Ve\u1e37\u1e37\u0101lar is the modern name for the hereditary musician caste (formerly Melakkarar) in Tamil Nadu [74, 75]. Periya M\u0113\u1e37am refers to the instrumental ensemble used for temple and lifecycle rituals [76]. Briga denotes extremely fast musical passages played on the n\u0101gasvaram [77]. R\u0101gam refers to the melodic mode and the practice of improvisation [77].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The article discusses Periya M\u0113\u1e37am music and its relationship with Karnatak (concert) music [76, 78]. Specific focus is given to extended improvisation (r\u0101ga \u0101l\u0101panai) and the TOdi r\u0101gam [77, 79].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Analyzed instruments include the n\u0101gasvaram (double-reed aerophone), tavil (drum), talam (cymbals), and the bari n\u0101gasvaram (a lower-pitched instrument invented by Pillai) [76, 80].\n* **Musical Structure:** Focus is placed on the shift from extended improvisation to composition-oriented repertoire and the adoption of the bari (low-pitched) instrument [80, 81].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author conducted primary fieldwork in 1986-87, with additional data collection through 1999 [82]. Evidence includes interviews with musicians and patrons, analysis of 78 rpm recordings, newspaper advertisements, and film portrayals of Pillai [80, 83, 84]."

The image of the Baul as a \"folk icon\" was manipulated for various agendas, ranging from Rabindranath Tagore\u2019s nationalist \"Religion of Man\" to fundamentalist Muslim critiques of moral degeneracy [85-88].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author draws on Partha Chatterjee\u2019s analysis of the \"inner private sphere\" of culture and spirituality used by the bhadralok to preserve values against colonial dominance [87, 89, 90]. He also discusses the \"pizza effect\" (or curry effect) regarding how scholarly constructs are re-appropriated by practitioners [91].\n* **Key Terms:** Baul is a term usually glossed as \"mad\" or \"insane,\" referring to wandering minstrels and ascetics [92, 93]. Maner Manus (Man of the Heart) refers to the divine essence hidden within the human body microcosm [94]. Bhadralok refers to the educated upper-middle-class elite of Calcutta [87]. Akhra refers to the center or monastery where Baul festivals are held [95].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The article focuses on Baul Gan (Baul songs), particularly those attributed to the poet Lalan Fakir [96-98].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** The primary instrument discussed is the ektara (single-stringed instrument), along with cymbals and drums [99, 100].\n* **Musical Structure:** Baul music is described as an eclectic synthesis of folk humanism, Tantric imagery, and Sufi mysticism, characterized by spontaneity and \"unpremeditated art\" [94, 101].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author analyzed historical data, 19th-century colonial reports (Ward, Wilson, Martin), 20th-century scholarly studies (Sen, Bhattacarya), and the poetic texts of Lalan Fakir and his disciples [85, 102-104]."

Nakassis argues that these discourses mobilize the historical stigma of cinema and a Dravidianist politics of purity, creating an identity politics where authenticity is deferred to the unseen Tamil \"family girl,\" while the onscreen heroine remains a \"mute foreign body\" [105-108].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author uses the \"performativity of the image\" to show how onscreen actions are interpreted as morally implicating offscreen acts [109, 110]. He applies the concept of \"kinship chronotopes\" to explain how the male gaze (sight a\u1e6dikkiratu) figures actresses as non-kin [111]. He also utilizes Silverstein\u2019s \"shifter\" to describe how the scale of identity shifts across contexts [112].\n* **Key Terms:** Kat\u0101n\u0101yaki means heroine [113]. Tamilacci denotes a traditional, ethnic Tamil woman who follows the respectable \"culture\" of Tamil Nadu [114, 115]. Sight a\u1e6dikkiratu refers to a sexualizing male gaze of ogling women in public [111, 116]. Karpu refers to the ideological nexus of female chastity central to Dravidian politics [117].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The article discusses film songs, the \"item number,\" and playback singing [116, 118]. It specifically analyzes a reality television program, *Tamil P\u0113sum Kat\u0101n\u0101yaki* (Tamil-speaking Heroine) [113, 119].\n* **Musical Structure:** Discussion of \"high-register\" oratorical Tamil and \"pure\" pronunciation (shibboleths) as markers of identity [120-122].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nMethodology included interviews with film industry insiders (actresses like Vadivukkarasi, directors, and producers) and audiences, as well as participation as a guest judge on a Raj TV reality show [105, 110, 111, 113]."

Van Der Linden demonstrates that the courts of the ten Sikh gurus and later Sikh maharajas mirrored Mughal court culture in their patronage of musicians, use of instruments, and processes of institutionalization [123-126].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author employs the \"imperial encounter\" to explain the emergence of elitist distinctions between art and folk music [127, 128]. He references the \"Singh Sabha reformation\" (Punjabi Enlightenment) as crucial to the development of modern \"orthodox\" Sikh kirtan [128, 129].\n* **Key Terms:** Kirtan refers to Sikh sacred music [130]. Rababi denotes musicians from the lineage of Mardana who traditionally played the rabab [130, 131]. Ragi refers to amateur or professional Sikh musicians from within the community [132, 133]. Dhadhis are professional folk musicians who perform heroic ballads (vars) [134, 135].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The primary genres discussed are dhrupad, khayal, and heroic ballads known as vars [135-137].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Instruments analyzed include the rabab, naqqara (kettledrum), sarangi (bowed lute), dhadhas (small drums), narsinga (horn), and shehnai [130, 138-141]. The later introduction of the Western harmonium is also noted [142].\n* **Musical Structure:** The Sikh sacred scripture (Guru Granth Sahib) is organized based on 31 ragas and includes a list of musical modes known as the ragamala [143, 144].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author used Sikh traditional writings (janam sakhis, Adi Granth), Persian historical sources (Memoirs of Jahangir, Abu\u2019l Fazl), and colonial accounts (Vigne, Osborne) [145-149]. Evidence also included the study of Sikh court paintings and murals [141, 150, 151]."

She argues that these performances create \"heterotopias\" that allow for the reversal of oppressive norms and the expression of Dalit subjectivity [152-154].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author uses Foucault\u2019s \"heterotopia\" to describe performance spaces as \"counter-sites\" where marginalized identities are invented and contested [153]. She applies the \"intersectionality\" of gender and caste to uncover blind spots in mainstream Indian feminism [155-157]. She also highlights the \"rationalist/materialist\" philosophies of Periyar and Ambedkar [158].\n* **Key Terms:** Gaana is an edgy folk music characterized by earthy lyrics and hard-driving rhythms from urban Chennai [159]. Parai is a traditional Dalit drum, often previously stigmatized due to its association with funerals [160, 161]. Thimir refers to the audacity or defiance projected by female gaana singers to disrupt expectations of modesty [162]. Dalit feminism is the specific addressing of both caste and gender oppression [155].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Genres discussed include rap, gaana, therukoothu (street theater), and oppari (mourning songs) [159, 161, 163]. Specific works like \"Enjoy Enjaami\" and \"I\u2019m sorry, Ayyappa\" are analyzed [164-166].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Instruments include the parai (drum), mridangam, dappu (frame drum), and tappa\u1e6d\u1e6dam [157, 160, 163, 167, 168].\n* **Musical Structure:** The music blends spoken word, hip-hop rhythms, and indigenous folk elements like ululation and percussive dance beats [161, 168, 169].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author performed a qualitative analysis of Dalit youth performances and music videos, incorporating interviews with lyricists and singers like Arivu and Isaivani [152, 156, 160, 170]."

Widdess argues that while notation and theory (literate forms) exist, music remains primarily oral/aural, with performance being a contextual re-construction governed by internalized cognitive schemas [171-174].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** Widdess applies Walter Ong\u2019s \"Orality and Literacy\" to describe the temporal, memory-dependent nature of South Asian music [175, 176]. He uses Parry and Lord\u2019s \"oral theory\" to compare musical performance to oral composition [172, 177]. He also utilizes \"schema theory\" to explain memory structures that organize musical experience [178, 179].\n* **Key Terms:** R\u0101ga is a tonal framework for composition and improvisation [180, 181]. T\u0101la refers to the metrical cycle or metrical schema [182, 183]. \u0100l\u0101p is the unmeasured melodic expansion that typically precedes a metrical composition [181, 184]. D\u0101ph\u0101 refers to the devotional singing traditions of the Newar farmers in Nepal [185].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The article covers Hindustani and Karnatik classical music and Newar temple singing (d\u0101ph\u0101) [180, 185].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Mentioned instruments include the v\u012b\u1e47\u0101, tabl\u0101, and sarod [173, 181, 186].\n* **Musical Structure:** Discussion includes solmization syllables (s\u0101, re, ga, ma, etc.), 10-beat metrical cycles, and the use of tih\u0101\u012b (tripartite rhythmic cadences) to resolve relationships between melody and meter [173, 182, 187].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nEvidence is drawn from 5th-century terracotta reliefs, the 7th-century Ku\u1e0dumiy\u0101malai rock inscription, medieval palm-leaf manuscripts, and modern printed notation-books by V.N.

Wolf argues that drumming is interpretively ambiguous, allowing localized meanings and communal identities to be embodied through rhythmic patterns that can signify both grief and victory [190-192].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author uses \"embodiment\" to show how emotions are manifested through the body in rituals like matam [193, 194]. He applies \"emotional complexity\" (ambivalence/multivalence) to describe the shifting affective configurations assigned to music [195, 196]. He also references Sherry Ortner\u2019s \"key-scenarios\" and \"summarizing symbols\" [194, 197].\n* **Key Terms:** Muharram is the Sh\u012b\u02bf\u012b observance commemorating the battle of Karbala [198]. Matam denotes mourning, specifically the practice of breast beating or the specific drum rhythm that accompanies it [194, 199]. Tasa is a shallow, bowl-shaped kettle-drum central to Muharram ensembles [200, 201]. Gham refers to the emotional modality of sorrow [192, 202].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Genres include processional drumming rhythms (matam\u012b, sav\u0101r\u012b, kalma), and recited poetic forms like marsiyah, soz, sal\u0101m, and nauhah [203-207].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Instruments include the dhol (cylindrical drum), tasa (kettle-drum), jhanjh (cymbals), naqq\u0101rah (deep kettle-drum), and shehnai (double-reed aerophone) [200, 201, 208].\n* **Musical Structure:** The article analyzes the use of drum patterns as slogans denoting speech, such as \"Ya Ali Ya Husain\" [209, 210]. It also explores how timbre and tempo (languid vs. brisk) contribute to aesthetics of mourning [192, 211, 212].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author conducted two-and-a-half years of fieldwork with ritual drummers in Lahore (Pakistan) and Lucknow (India), as well as Karachi, Delhi, and Hyderabad [190, 213]. Evidence includes interviews, field recordings, and analysis of Urdu religious pamphlets [213-215]."

He argues against seeing tribal music as a primitive survival, instead modeling it as a set of distinct organizational principles\u2014such as rhythmic asynchrony and bitonality\u2014that are central to the broader South Asian musical area [216-219].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author distinguishes between \"essentialist\" (what they share because they are tribes) and \"agentive\" (what they actively emphasize for identity) approaches [220]. He references Durkheim\u2019s \"elementary forms\" to describe how scholars often infantilize tribal culture [218].\n* **Key Terms:** \u0100div\u0101s\u012b is the modern term for tribal, meaning \"original inhabitant\" [221]. Phasing refers to the slightly offbeat or out-of-phase relationship between melody and drum rhythm [222]. Kota refers to a Nilgiri tribe of musicians, blacksmiths, and artisans [223]. Kol is the Kota double-reed, conical bore aerophone [224].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Focuses on Nilgiri tribal music (Kota, Irula, Toda, Kurumba), specifically instrumental melodies for rituals like \"fire lighting\" or food offerings [225-227].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Instruments discussed include the kol (shawm), dobar and kinvar (cylindrical drums), taba\u1e6dk (frame drum), and kob (brass horns) [224].\n* **Musical Structure:** Structural features include \"separable entities\" where melody and meter function independently, bitonality (singing the same melody at different pitch levels), and parallel harmonies [228-230].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nInformation was collected during fieldwork in the Nilgiri hills (Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka) between 1990-92 [223]. Methodology involved local areal studies, comparative analysis of drum ostinatos (cada d\u0101k), and critiques of 19th-century colonial census and travelogues [231-233]."

    "content": "# Being \u2018Rasikas\u2019: The Affective Pleasures of Music and Dance Spectatorship and Nationhood in Indian Middle-Class Modernity\n**Citation:** Ram, Kalpana. \"Being \u2018Rasikas\u2019: The Affective Pleasures of Music and Dance Spectatorship and Nationhood in Indian Middle-Class Modernity.\" *Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute* 17 (2011): S159-S175.\n\n## Core Argument &amp; Scope\nThe article argues that Indian classical performance traditions have preserved a dynamic and agential understanding of tradition that engages the affects of spectators more effectively than nationalist interpretations [1]. It explores the subject position of the *rasika* as a distinctive way of inhabiting the present within Indian middle-class modernity [1, 2]. The scope includes side-stepping historical debates over the origins of these traditions to focus on a phenomenological description of spectatorship and its relation to class privilege and nationalist subject formation [3-5].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author utilizes a phenomenology of spectatorship to describe how participants are solicited into agency and affective involvement [3]. The article also engages with Sanskritization as a historical process that pre-dates nationalism and Orientalism, influencing the classicization of forms like *Kathakali* [6]. Additionally, the author critiques Bourdieu\u2019s class analysis, attempting to move beyond art as purely a complex of differential class distinctions [4].\n* **Key Terms:** *Rasika* refers to a connoisseur or listener addressed as being capable of savouring the *rasa*, or essence, of the arts [2, 7]. *Rasa* is defined as the distilled juice or flavour of an experience presented for aesthetic enjoyment [2, 7]. *Bh\u0101vas* are the bodily experiences of affects that serve as raw ingredients to be cooked or elaborated into *rasas* by performers [8]. *Parampara* signifies an unbroken, handed-down heritage or tradition [9].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The article discusses Carnatic music, *Bharata Natyam*, *Kutiattam*, *Kathakali*, *Kuchipudi*, *Kathak*, and the North Indian *dhrupad* style [6, 10, 11]. Specific repertoire items mentioned include the *tillana*, *varnam*, and *kirtanam* [12-15].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Instruments mentioned include drone instruments such as the North Indian *tanpura* and the Southern *tambura* [16]. Percussion is referred to through the mention of drums maintaining the *t\u0101la* cycle [17, 18].\n* **Musical Structure:** Discussion includes *R\u0101gas* (distinctive melodic shapes with ascending and descending pitches), *T\u0101la* (units of variable time length determining tempo), and *gamaka* (melismas or ornaments) [14, 17, 19, 20]. The article also analyzes the *alap* as a rich affective space [6, 12].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author employs phenomenological description of spectatorship and ethnographic observation of performances in India [3, 10, 21]. Evidence is drawn from textual analysis of the *Natyasastra*, archival descriptions of performers like Bala Saraswati, and personal accounts of attending concerts in Kerala and Delhi [10, 22-25]."

This construction provided ideological justification for the pre-colonial Peshwa state to appropriate the labor and sexuality of lower-caste women through enslavement [26]. The scope extends through the colonial period and into the emergence of national cultural forms like Marathi cinema, tracking the \"drain of sexuality\" and the marginalization of traditional performers [26].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The article utilizes a feminist exploration of the \"male gaze\" to analyze how female desire is articulated and constructed in performance [26]. It also employs a framework of Brahmanical patriarchy to explain the simultaneous appropriation of productive and sexual labor [26]. The concept of \"Embourgeoisement\" is used to describe the shift in the *tamasha* audience and the subsequent labeling of traditional troupes as obscene [26].\n* **Key Terms:** *Lavani* is defined as a rural erotic song genre belonging to the *shahiri* or folk tradition of Maharashtra [26]. *Tamasha* refers to folk theatre troupes that traditionally included devotional offerings and comic acts alongside *lavani* [26]. *Sangeet Baree* describes troupes formed and managed by women of the Kolhati caste where the performance of *lavani* was crucial [26]. *Bateek* refers to female slaves bought specifically for sexual labor [26].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The article focuses on *Lavani* (including spiritual and erotic forms), *Powada* (ballads of bravery), and *Tamasha* folk theatre [26]. Specific modes of *lavani* mentioned include *ada* (expressive), *baleghati* (emotional), and *chhakkad* (erotic) [26].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** The harmonium is mentioned as a place where rewards for performers were deposited [26]. Dancers wear *ghungroos* (ankle bells) which often weigh at least five kilograms [26].\n* **Musical Structure:** The article discusses compositions woven around *shringar* (worldly eroticism) and *virah* (the pain of separation) [26].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author gathered information through archival research, specifically analyzing the official records of the Peshwas and the *Peshwa Daftar* in Pune [26]. Additional evidence is drawn from field interviews andInteraction with *sangeet baree* artistes and the documentation of their life histories [26]."

Allen. \"Ecology of the Global Tabla Industry.\" *Ethnomusicology* 59, no. 2 (2015): 315-336.\n\n## Core Argument &amp; Scope\nThis article analyzes the global *tabla* industry as an ecosystem where musical artisans, instruments, and global demand interact [27]. Using actor-network theory, the author argues that changes in instrument manufacture\u2014driven by global markets, climate change, and international trade policies\u2014ultimately transform the sound produced by musicians [27, 28]. The scope spans from local workshops in Banaras to global retailers and performers in the United States and Australia [29, 30].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author primarily uses Actor-Network Theory (ANT) to treat instruments and materials as non-human actors that influence musical outcomes [28, 31]. The article also draws on \"Ecomusicology,\" thinking ecologically about musical production [32]. It references \"Fordism\" to describe the commoditization and streamlined division of labor in wholesale manufacturing [33, 34].\n* **Key Terms:** *Lokavidya* is defined as people\u2019s knowledge, referring to the embodied, lived knowledge acquired through a lifetime of artisanal practice [35, 36]. *Jug\u0101\u1e0d karn\u0101* translates roughly to \"making do\" or improvising creative solutions with limited resources [29, 37]. *Khand\u0101ni k\u0101m* refers to \"family work\" within hereditary traditions [35]. *Pudi* is the term for the drum-head of the tabla [38].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The focus is on the Hindustani music tradition, specifically the performance of \"Banaras Soul Music\" using *thumri* and *dadra* styles [39].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** The *tabla* is the primary instrument of analysis, consisting of a *pudi* (drum-head) and a resonator [40, 41]. Specific technical parts described include the *gajr\u0101* (the woven outer ring of buffalo hide) and the *sy\u0101h\u012b* (black tuning paste) [32, 37, 42].\n* **Musical Structure:** The author discusses tuning processes and the creation of a \"signature sound\" through the interaction of the drum-head and resonator [40, 43]. It also mentions *talas* (rhythmic cycles) used in performance [39].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author used an ecologically-minded methodology grounded in Actor-Network Theory, conducting field interviews and participant observation in *tabla* maker workshops in Banaras [27, 29]. Evidence includes oral histories of the *tabla*-making community, observation of material sourcing (like rawhide evaluation), and technical analysis of instrument construction [35, 44, 45]."

Using North Indian classical music as a case study, the study demonstrates that Western participants can learn to identify distinctive modal features of *r\u0101gas* after only short periods of exposure [47, 48]. The scope covers music cognition, implicit learning mechanisms, and the cross-cultural perception of melodic structures [49, 50].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The study is framed by theories of music cognition and implicit learning, specifically the ability to acquire knowledge without conscious awareness of rules [46, 51]. It also utilizes statistical learning theory, which assumes perception is grounded in the frequency and probability of musical events [52, 53].\n* **Key Terms:** *Alap* is an unaccompanied, wholly improvised melodic genre used to expose and develop a *r\u0101ga* [54]. *Jor* is a second introductory section where the same melodic features are explored in a rhythmic style [55]. *Pakar* refers to specific melodic phrases that uniquely identify a particular *r\u0101ga* [56]. *Bimusicalism* describes the ability to incidentally learn the principles of a novel musical system alongside one's native system [57].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The focus is North Indian Classical Music, also known as Hindustani music [58, 59]. The study specifically utilizes the *r\u0101gas* *To\u1e5b\u012b* and *Mult\u0101n\u012b* [60].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** The recordings used for the study were performed by a professional professional player on the *sit\u0101r* [61, 62]. It also mentions the *sarod* and *s\u0101ra\u1e45g\u012b* as typical melody instruments [63].\n* **Musical Structure:** The article analyzes *R\u0101ga* as a modal concept combining a specific scale with characteristic melodic patterns and tonal hierarchies [64-66]. It also discusses microtonal intonation and the semitonal division of the octave [67, 68].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe authors employed an ecologically valid experimental design using real recorded performances rather than synthetic stimuli [64, 69]. They gathered evidence from behavioral responses of sixty-five Western adults, including familiarity ratings and binary confidence judgments [70, 71]. Computational measurements of the sympathetic strings of the *sit\u0101r* were used to analyze intonation [72]."

The scope includes a comparative analysis of Syrian Christian and Jewish liturgical rites to demonstrate a possible common origin in the ancient Middle East [74, 75].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The article utilizes a comparative ritual and musical framework, focusing on the preservation of tradition through cultural isolation and resistance to Portuguese, Dutch, and British influences [73, 74].\n* **Key Terms:** *Keralamaryada* is a system of laws and rules of behavior based on chivalry and scrupulous regard for the rights of every caste [76, 77]. *Kadmoyo* is a musical mode equivalent to Arabic *bayat* and ecclesiastical Dorian [78]. *Hamisoyo* is a musical mode equivalent to Arabic *rast* and ecclesiastical Ionian [78]. *Organum* refers to a style of congregational singing in parallel 4ths, 5ths, and octaves [79, 80].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The focus is on Syrian Christian Liturgical Music, including Bible reading, chants, responses, antiphons, and hymn tunes [79, 81, 82]. It also compares these with Jewish cantillation and Hindu Rigvedic chant [81, 83].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Instruments mentioned include church bells and unidentified sistrum-like rattles fastened to long poles [84, 85].\n* **Musical Structure:** The music utilizes a non-diastematic (non-intervallic) accentuation system represented by a dot notation [81]. Melodic structure is based on *risquole* (favored melodic formulae) and modes corresponding to Arabic *maqamat* [86]. Rhythm is described as logogenic, meaning it is governed by the metric structure of the verse [82].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nInformation was gathered through archival research on historical Syrian and Hebrew texts and aural analysis of contemporary liturgical performances in India [81, 86, 87]. The author also utilized electronic measuring of main intervals using a stroboscope to confirm intonational consistency with Middle Eastern maqams [85]."

It argues that while online lessons maintain quality, significant structural shifts\u2014such as the loss of physical contact and simultaneous playing\u2014transform learning from a communal experience of embodiment into an individually focused, directions-based pedagogy [89-91]. The scope covers both Hindustani and Karnatak traditions in modern global contexts [92, 93].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author employs the concept of \"bi-musicality\" to study learning from the inside [94]. The article also uses structural linguistics, applying the distinction between *langue* (rules/grammar) and *parole* (speech/action) to music learning [95, 96]. It references \"mediascapes\" to explain how technological reality is subjectively perceived [97, 98].\n* **Key Terms:** *Sina-ba-sina* literally means \"chest to chest\" or \"heart to heart,\" signifying the total material and immaterial bond between teacher and student [99, 100]. *Talim* is an elaborate ritual of instruction [101]. *Riyaz* refers to the practice necessary for the body to instruments to explore musical spaces [102]. *Gharana* refers to a lineage of musicians [92].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The article focuses on Indian Classical Music, including the *Imdad Khani* gharana of Hindustani music and the Karnatak tradition [92]. Repertoire includes *r\u0101gas*, *kritis*, and *palt\u0101* exercises [103-105].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Instruments mentioned include the *sit\u0101r*, *surbah\u0101r*, *v\u012b\u1e47\u0101*, violin, and electronic *tanpura* machines [92, 106, 107].\n* **Musical Structure:** Pedagogical elements include repetition of \"chunks,\" simultaneous playing, and *sanchara* phrases (key identifying phrases of a r\u0101ga) [103, 108, 109]. It also discusses the use of *gamakams* (ornaments) [107].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author conducted virtual fieldwork involving fifteen Skype chat conversations with thirteen musicians and five lessons administered via Messages [110]. This was supplemented by face-to-face participant observation, including interviews, observations of vocal lessons, and two years of participation in the UCLA Indian music ensemble [106, 111]."

It analyzes how these songs display \"musical heart\" and use a specific \"romantic song formula\" to negotiate cultural dualities like tradition versus modernity [114-116]. The scope involves a comparative analysis between Bollywood song sequences and the Hollywood film musical [113, 117].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author applies *Rasa* theory to explain the emotional experience of beauty in film [118, 119]. The article also uses the \"dual-focus narrative\" framework to compare the ideological tensions in American and Indian musicals [116, 120]. It examines the \"cinematic gaze,\" distinguishing between the adoring adoring gaze of the hero and the objectifying gaze of the villain [121, 122].\n* **Key Terms:** *Picturisation* refers to the visual images and actions accompanying a film song [123]. *Sringar rasa* is the primary emotional genre, encompassing erotic and romantic love, including both union (*sambhoga*) and separation (*vipralamba*) [124, 125]. *Mujra* is a song and dance performed by a courtesan for an on-screen audience [126, 127].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Focuses on Hindi film songs, specifically the romantic social genre [128].

It argues that these tales are less about the women themselves and more about the downfall of courtiers who allow passionate love (*'ishq*) and music to undermine their political duty and self-control [140-142]. The scope focuses on the heyday of the Mughal empire from Akbar to Muhammad Shah [139].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The article uses a framework of spatial segregation to categorize female performers based on their access to male and female spaces [143-145]. It also explores the concept of \"liminality,\" where musicians of low rank could enter elite social spaces during performance [143].\n* **Key Terms:** *Tawa\u2019if* is a term that later designated elite female performing artists [146, 147]. *Mehfil* refers to an intimate musical gathering in male space [148]. *Haram* signifies the \"forbidden\" female space of the women's quarters [144]. *'Ishq* is passionate love, often viewed as a threat to a nobleman's reason and power [141, 149].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The article identifies various performing communities including *p\u0101turs*, *l\u016bl\u012bs*, *kancan\u012bs*, and *d\u014dmn\u012bs* (auspicious singers) [147, 150].

Focusing on Miyan Zia-ud-din\u2019s *Hayy al-Arw\u0101h*, the author posits that the act of meticulously recording the lineages and migrations of scattered musicians was a strategy to mitigate the existential threat posed by the political upheaval of the period [157, 159, 160]. The scope covers the decline of Mughal Delhi between 1739 and 1788 [161, 162].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The article combines a history of emotions with biocognitive studies, distinguishing between fear (triggered by present danger) and anxiety (triggered by unpredictable future threats) [157, 159, 163]. It also treats the *tazkira* genre as a form of \"ego-document\" that reveals the author's social and communal self [164-166].\n* **Key Terms:** *Tazkira* is a biographical collection or \"memorative communication\" [164, 167]. *Hang\u0101ma-i Abdal\u012b* refers to the turmoil and scattering of people caused by Ahmad Shah Abdali\u2019s invasions [161, 162, 168]. *Rasika* refers to a connoisseur capable of \"tasting\" emotional essences [169]. *Fir\u0101q* is the pain of longing for an absent beloved [170, 171].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Elite art music forms discussed include *r\u0101gas*, *dhrupad*, *khay\u0101l*, and *tappa* [172].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Instruments listed as central to this period include the *rudra v\u012b\u1e47\u0101*, *rab\u0101b*, *pakh\u0101waj*, *s\u0101rang\u012b*, *sit\u0101r*, and *tabla* [167].\n* **Musical Structure:** The author discusses *Rasa* theory and *r\u0101gam\u0101l\u0101* iconography as the primary frames for musical experience [173-175].

It demonstrates how Dalit theologians reclaim devalued folk music styles and village religious metaphors to make Christianity contextually meaningful and socially transformative for the oppressed [181-183]. The scope focuses on the Protestant community in Tamil Nadu from the sixteenth century to the present [180, 184].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author utilizes a \"transculturation\" framework to describe the transformation of musical and extra-musical ideas through culture contact [185, 186]. The study also applies an \"indigenization taxonomy\" adapted from Steven Kaplan to categorize musical styles based on their cultural value and relationship to mission societies [187, 188]. It engages with Dalit liberation theology as a means of psychological and social transformation [182, 189].\n* **Key Terms:** *Dalit* means \"broken\" or \"oppressed,\" referring to formerly untouchable communities [190]. *Adi Samayam* refers to the \"old religion\" or village goddess traditions distinct from Brahminical Hinduism [182, 191]. *Kirttanai* are devotional songs composed in karnatak style [192, 193]. *Oppari* is a folk lament or weeping genre performed primarily at funerals [194, 195].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The article discusses Western hymns (*p\u00e3m\u00e3lai*), karnatak *kirttanai*, evangelical \"light\" music, and Tamil folk music [183, 193, 196-198].

It argues that the genre developed in close interaction with commercial, technological, and institutional systems\u2014such as the radio, the black market, and the Censor Board\u2014becoming India\u2019s predominant popular music by transcending linguistic and social barriers [209-211].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author uses a historical survey framework to track how the film industry responded to socio-political events like the independence movement and World War II [209, 212]. It also analyzes institutional control over listener taste through broadcasting policies [213, 214].\n* **Key Terms:** *Playback song* refers to the pre-recording of songs for actors to lip-sync, which revolutionized the status of singers and music directors [215, 216]. *Formula film* denotes commercial features structured with specific hero/villain tropes and approximately six song-and-dance numbers [217]. *Hybrid music* was a term of reproach used by purists to describe film songs that blended Indian and foreign musical elements [218, 219].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Focuses on Hindi film songs, which began as prose intonations and evolved into full refrain-verse compositions [220, 221]. It also mentions the \"Middle Cinema\" movement and its focus on period-appropriate songs [222].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Traditional instruments mentioned include *sitar*, *tabla*, *harmonium*, *sarod*, and violin [223]. Modern influences added saxophones, electric guitars, synthesizers, and advanced recording technology [221, 224].\n* **Musical Structure:** Early film songs were characterized by a \"light classical\" singing style derived from K.L. Saigal\u2019s soft-tone technique [223, 225]. Later songs adopted the Western tempered scale and diverse rhythms like American jazz and Latin-American patterns [218, 224, 226].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author gathered information through a historical survey of the Indian film industry\u2019s development [209]. Evidence includes analysis of landmark films (like *Alam Ara* and *Devdas*), study of broadcasting policies from All India Radio and Radio Ceylon, and review of technological advancements in sound recording [225, 227-229]."

It argues that this \"adolescent-girl falsetto\" became an ideal through a conjunction of nationalist discourse, middle-class \"purification\" projects aimed at purging Muslim and courtesan influences, and the cultural meanings associated with modern developmental regimes like the five-year plans [232-235].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author utilizes nationalist discourse theory to analyze \"woman\" as a sign for the nation [236, 237]. It also employs a framework regarding the cultural production of space, where landscape and territory become markers of culture and \"civil\" modernity [238, 239]. The article engages with the relationship between orality and literacy in popular culture [233, 240].\n* **Key Terms:** *Playback singing* refers to the voice provided by a specialist for on-screen actors [241]. *FYP hero* is the Five-Year Plan hero who represents post-independence masculinist ideals of being \"scientific\" and \"rational\" [235, 242]. *Tawaif* is the Muslim courtesan figure whose tonality was purged from the \"ideal\" national voice [243, 244].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Focuses on Indian film music (specifically Lata Mangeshkar's corpus) and Hindustani classical music [236, 240, 245]. It contrasts Mangeshkar's style with the \"Kotha\" (brothel/courtesan) style [243].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** While the voice is the primary focus, the author mentions regional styles like the *Dholi Gayikayen* of Rajasthan who sing with large drums called *Dhol* [246].\n* **Musical Structure:** The article defines Mangeshkar's style by its specificfalsetto tonality and shrill girl-child timbre [231, 233]. It discusses the shift from a \"patron-performer-audience nexus\" to a compositional approach based on notation [240, 247].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author utilizes a cultural analysis of nationalist and gendered discourses in post-colonial India [236, 248]. Evidence is drawn from biographical accounts of Mangeshkar, historical records of radio broadcasting policies under B.V. Keskar, and close reading of on-screen male and female personas in Hindi films of the 1950s and 1960s [235, 249-251]."

It argues that Bansode's life represents a complex negotiation between the performance of the \"erotic\" for livelihood and the contestation of private and public patriarchy [1, 2]. The scope includes the historical transition of Tamasha from a communal folk form to a stigmatized practice under \"modern\" Dalit morality and state oversight [3-5].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author utilizes Dalit feminism and intersectionality to analyze the triply discriminated life of performers [2]. It also employs the concept of \"interlocking technologies\" to describe the inseparable forces of caste, gender, and labor [1, 6].\n* **Key Terms:** Tamasha is a traveling folk theater form of Maharashtra that combines skit, song, and dance [3, 7]. Lavani refers to the folkloric singing and erotic dance integral to Tamasha performance [8]. Tamasgir is the term for a professional Tamasha performer [1]. Khandani refers to a family's hereditary lineage or traditional occupation [9].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The article discusses the genres of Tamasha and Lavani, including various types of Lavanya such as devotional, puranic, and shringarik (erotic) [3, 8]. It also mentions Jalsa, a form of folk drama used for political protest and social change [10].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Instruments mentioned include the Dholki (drum), Harmonium, and Ghungroo (ankle bells) [11-13].\n* **Musical Structure:** The text notes the use of *adakari* (gestures) and \"rough music\" as a tool for ridicule or protest against male audiences [8, 14]. It mentions a hierarchy of wages among performers and the use of \"pattern tunes\" for specific meters [15, 16].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author utilizes a methodology combining oral history, ethnographic fieldwork, and social biography [6, 17].

It argues that this transformation was driven by 20th-century nationalism and the rationalization of traditional music by academic musicologists to reflect a \"scientific\" practice [20, 22, 23].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The study uses the framework of colonial modernity and cultural nationalism to explain how social pressures changed musical concepts [20, 24]. It also references Hasty's theory of metric projection to understand non-isochronous periodicity [25].\n* **Key Terms:** Tita is a traditional categorical term referring to a repeating pattern of cymbal strokes [26]. M\u0101tr\u0101 is a term for a homogeneous, isochronous time unit [27, 28].

Specific dance pieces mentioned include Musala\u1e0di Vannama and Ma\u1e43galam [32, 33].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** The G\u00e4ta beraya is a barrel drum whose strokes correspond to mnemonic spoken syllables [34]. T\u0101lampa\u1e6da refers to a pair of small hand-held cymbals [35]. The Taliya is a small hand-held gong [36].\n* **Musical Structure:** The article analyzes the shift from the \"akshara\" system (syllable-count) to the \"m\u0101trika\" system (precise pulse-count) [37]. It details various *tita* labels (tani-tita, de-tita, etc.) based on the number of cymbal strokes per cycle [26].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author reconstructs historical practices by reading 20th-century isochronous-based texts \"against the grain\" [38]. Evidence includes analysis of palm-leaf manuscripts (e.g., T\u0101la\u1e43 1843), comparative cross-cultural analysis of Indian *tala* systems, and ethnographic observations of ritual performances [39-41]."

It argues that the Maratha rulers used these dramas to create a \"literary pluralism\" that combined local Telugu and Tamil traditions with Maratha identity to legitimize their rule [43-45].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author utilizes concepts of cosmopolitanism and vernacularization to describe the interaction between regional and trans-regional literary cultures [43, 46]. It also discusses the \"aestheticization of language\" in the context of courtly power [43].\n* **Key Terms:** Yakshagana is a genre of musical dance-drama favored at the Tanjavur court [42, 47]. Padam refers to a lyrical song form used in drama and dance [48]. Daru is a musical drama form characterized by specific rhythmic and melodic patterns [47, 49].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The article focuses on Yakshagana dramas, Kuravanji (dance-drama of a fortune-teller), and Kirtana (devotional singing) [42, 48, 50]. It discusses the use of the \"Tanjavur Quartette\" in establishing dance traditions [51].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** While less detailed on construction, the text mentions the use of sarangi, tabla, and cymbals in dance ensembles [52, 53].\n* **Musical Structure:** It describes the *asthayi-antara* structure of songs and the use of South Indian *ragas* and *talas* in dramatic compositions [49, 54].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe research is based on the textual analysis of Marathi and Telugu manuscripts found in the Tanjavur Maharaja Serfoji's Sarasvati Mahal Library [55, 56].

It argues that while both systems utilize melodic formulas and scalar frameworks, the *raga* system remains a \"practical foundation of self-renewing spontaneous creativity,\" whereas Church modes became an analytical scheme for classifying melodies [59, 60].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author employs comparative musicology to evaluate the \"formulaic character\" of modality across different cultures [61]. He distinguishes between \"variation technique\" and \"free improvisation\" using short motifs [62, 63].\n* **Key Terms:** Raga is a melodic scheme serving as a canvas for a variety of songs [64]. Alapana is the style of improvised raga exposition performed to meaningless syllables [65]. Gamaka refers to a functionally essential ornamented note [66, 67].

It argues that the scene allows middle-class youth to channel social and political frustrations into a translocal identity that prioritizes artistic \"integrity\" over commercial \"selling out,\" while relying on specific social and economic resources [79-81].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The authors engage with subculture theory, scene theory, and the concept of \"neo-tribes\" [82-84]. They utilize the concept of \"translocalism\" to describe connections across regional and global metal communities [85, 86].\n* **Key Terms:** \"Underground\" refers to music that is not corporately sponsored and emphasizes creative independence [87, 88]. Boro Bhai or Murubbi are \"big brother\" gatekeepers who control access to gig slots and albums [89, 90].

It argues that *tarannum* serves a functional role by enhancing the emotional mood and memorability of poetry in a culture where secular music is often stigmatized [97, 99, 100].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author applies a model adapted from Merriam to analyze music across cultural, musical, conceptual, and functional perspectives [101].\n* **Key Terms:** Tarannum specifically denotes the chanting style used for the Urdu *ghazal* [98]. Mushaira is a poetic symposium for the oral presentation of work [102]. Ghazal is a popular poetic form consisting of self-contained couplets [103]. Parhna is the general term for reciting, which includes both spoken (*taht-ul-lafz*) and chanted (*tarannum*) styles [104].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The focus is on the *ghazal*, *qata* (fragment), and *nazm* (modern form) [103, 105]. Repertoire includes \"stock tunes\" associated with famous poets like Jigar Muradabadi [106, 107].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** *Tarannum* is traditionally performed without instruments, distinguishing it conceptually from \"singing\" [99, 104, 108].\n* **Musical Structure:** It features a binary formal scheme (A and B tunes) corresponding to the couplet's rhyme scheme [109, 110]. Rhythm is derived from quantitative poetic meters (*'aruz*), realized through short and long durational units [111, 112].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe study is based on participant observation in Urdu-speaking communities, semi-structured interviews with 27 informants, and the detailed musical transcription and analysis of 116 chanted poems [113-115]."

It argues that the recording industry and broadcast media acted as agents of hegemony, articulating a supra-local Muslim identity that was shaped by both market demands and national cultural policies [176, 178-180].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author utilizes Hebdige's concept of \"style\" and \"subculture\" to understand group identity in mass production [181, 182]. It also references \"identity management\" in colonial and post-colonial states [178, 180].\n* **Key Terms:** \"Muslim Devotional\" is the industry label for popular religious recordings [176]. Filmi qawwali refers to secular adaptations in cinema [183]. Tukbandi or narrative-didactic qawwali uses inserted verses (*girah*) to explain poems [184, 185].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Recorded Qawwali and Na't [176, 186]. Examples include Pearu Qawwal's \"Madine ka musafir hun\" and the Sabri Brothers' \"Tajdar-e-Haram\" [187, 188].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Studio instrumentation included harmonium, tabla, clarinet, and the bulbultarang (banjo) [189, 190].\n* **Musical Structure:** Early recordings focused on simple tunes for 78 rpm records; later long-play technology allowed for 20-minute studio replications of live ritual performances [187, 188, 191].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author provides a historical overview of the development of recorded qawwali, using evidence from recording archives (GCI/EMI), radio programming policies, and the analysis of famous recorded songs [177, 192, 193]."

It contrasts linear discursive time (text) with vertical \"moment time\" (ecstasy), demonstrating how this duality is rooted in Islamic and Sufi ideology [196-198].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author engages with the philosophy of time (Husserl, Bergson, Schutz) and Fabian's concept of \"coevalness\" [199-202].\n* **Key Terms:** Zaman (chronological time) vs. Waqt (moment/season) [203, 204]. Hal refers to the state of divine ecstasy [205]. Fana and Baqa are the complementary concepts of annihilation and sustenance [206]. Zikr is the repetitive verbal invocation that creates a circular temporal pattern [207].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Qawwali, with specific analysis of the song \"Chasm-e- Maste 'Ajabe\" by Amir Khusrau [194, 208].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Dholak (drum) and harmonium [209]. The drum provides an ostinato \"theka\" that incorporates the zikr accentuation [210].\n* **Musical Structure:** The article identifies two durational modes: regular metric pattern (for arousal) and non-metric verbal rhythm (for discourse) [211, 212]. It explains the \"allomorphic\" melodic endings used to signal repetition (*Takrar*) versus conclusion [213-215].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe study relies on intensive participation in Sufi centers in India and Pakistan, synthesizing musical analysis with Sufi ideological concepts through \"meaning-feeling\" experiences [216, 217]."

It focuses on the sarangi, arguing that its musical meaning is built on the tension between its stigmatized social origin in courtesan culture and its modern transformation into an abstract classical voice [247-250].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author utilizes the concept of \"embodied memory\" and Terdiman's \"materials memory\" [247, 251]. It also proposes an \"acoustemology beyond place\" to understand how sound makes sense across contexts [252, 253].\n* **Key Terms:** Sarangi is the primary bowed instrument of North Indian classical music [254].

Dean. \"Desire, Youth, and Realism in Tamil Cinema.\" Journal of Linguistic Anthropology 17, no. 1 (2007): 77\u2013104.\n\n## Core Argument &amp; Scope\nThe article argues that contemporary Tamil cinema has transitioned from \"fantastical\" masala formulas to a mode of \"realist spectatorship\" primarily embraced by male youth [3, 4]. This realism is defined by a high calibration between film form and viewer evaluation, where \"real\" is measured by truth-functional correspondence to the viewers' everyday lives [3-5].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** **Realist Spectatorship** is a mode where talk about film is organized by the assumption that films should be evaluated based on their correspondence with \"reality\" [5, 6]. **Chronotope Mapping** involves the alignment between the time-space of the film text and the social reality available to the viewers [7, 8].\n* **Key Terms:** **Masala Film** designates a genre of commercial Indian cinema that typically blends song-and-dance, romance, and action, often at the expense of logical coherence [9, 10]. **Nadippu** refers to \"play\" or acting that eventually morphs into love within the narrative [11, 12]. **Chastity** (Anandhi 2005) is a central cultural norm regarding women's propriety that influences how female desire is represented on-screen [13, 14].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The article discusses the role of film songs (paaddu) and dance sequences in representing desire, specifically in movies like *Anbee Vaa* (1966) and *7G Rainbow Colony* (2004) [15-17].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Not explicitly analyzed, though the presence of \"song-and-dance\" sequences is a major textual feature [18, 19].\n* **Musical Structure:** The \"Our Age\" (*Naam Vayathu*) song illustrates the thematic focus on youth concerns like premarital love and wasted years [20].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe researchers conducted recorded interviews with 25 viewers in Madurai, Chennai, and Villappuram between 2004 and 2005 [21].

He argues that while the vocalist holds primary authority, the performance is a site of \"subtle contestation\" where accompanists assert their individual voices through varied replication and the utilization of solo spaces [24, 25].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** **Hierarchy and Contestation** describe the tension between the soloist\u2019s defined primacy and the accompanist\u2019s strategies to subvert that subordination [24, 26]. **Solo-centered vs. Ensemble-centered Hearing** distinguishes between listening for the soloist\u2019s mastery versus the creative interplay of the whole group [27, 28].\n* **Key Terms:** **Sangat** refers to melodic accompaniment intended to complement the vocal line [29]. **Sam** is the first beat of the rhythmic time-cycle, serving as a crucial structural goal for both soloist and accompanist [30]. **Upaj** is a general term for the variable, invented aspects of performance [31].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The study focuses on North Indian classical vocal music, specifically the Khay\u0101l, Dhrupad, and T.humr\u0131\u0304 genres [32-35].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** The **S\u0101ra\u0144g\u0131\u0304** is a bowed, fretless lute, and the **Harmonium** is a modified keyboard aerophone used for accompaniment [29].

By juxtaposing classical music with religious imagery and devotional themes, media creates a metonymic association that makes music a symbol of Hindu piety and Brahminical identity [45, 46].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** **Metonymy and Metaphor** are used to explain the referential substitution of Karnatik music for devotion [47, 48]. **Model Reader** (Umberto Eco) describes the viewer who turns to music for a religious experience and uses cultural sub-codes to decode the religious-musical coupling [45, 49].\n* **Key Terms:** **Manodharma** refers to improvisational rhythmic and melodic expositions that are characteristic of Karnatik music [50]. **Bhakthi Movement** refers to a historical religious-philosophical movement that emphasized devotion as a tool for salvation [44, 51]. **Stacking** is a broadcast programming pattern where shows of similar appeal are grouped together to generate audience flow [52].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Karnatik music, specifically devotional compositions by the \"Trinity\" (Tyagaraja, Syama Sastri, Dikshitar), and film-based adaptations of these styles [44, 53, 54].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Mentions the **Veena** (stringed instrument) used in filmic miracles and the **Mridangam** (barrel drum) used for rhythm [55-57].\n* **Musical Structure:** Analyzes the use of specific **Ragas**, such as *Amritavarshini* (believed to bring rain) and *Shanmukhapriya* (dedicated to Lord Muruga) [58-60].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe authors performed qualitative content analysis of South Indian devotional and musical films from the 1930s to the 2000s [46, 61].

He argues that recruitment is based on an ascriptive system (lineage) rather than achievement, where specific social groups are traditionally designated for either solo or accompanist roles [66, 67].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** **Sanskritization** (M.N. Srinivas) explains the process where accompanist lineages attempt to raise their status by adopting the attributes and pedigrees of soloists [68, 69]. **Ascriptive Recruitment** refers to a system where individuals become soloists or accompanists because they are born into specific families or lineages [66, 70].\n* **Key Terms:** **Kalawant** refers to lineages of soloists who claim exclusive solo ancestry and high social rank [71, 72]. **Mirasi** refers to a social category of hereditary accompanists, often organized into territorial brotherhoods called **Biradari** [72, 73]. **Gharana** literally means \"of the House\" and refers to a musical tradition associated with a specific lineage of vocalists [73, 74].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Discusses the performance roles in Hindustani art music, involving both vocal and instrumental specialties [75].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** The **S\u0101ra\u0144g\u0131\u0304** and **Harmonium** are used for melodic accompaniment, while the **Tabla** provides rhythmic support [75].\n* **Musical Structure:** Discusses the **Theka**, the skeletal rhythmic structure of a cycle played by the drummer to maintain the time-cycle independently [76, 77].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nNeuman conducted ethnographic research in India between 1969 and 1971, collecting genealogies and interviewing musicians about their ancestry and social status [78-80]."

Neuman argues that the \"Islamization\" of patronage in the North transformed music from a Brahmanical devotional avocation into a professionalized craft practiced by skilled artisans [83-85].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** **Professionalization of Art** describes the shift from music as a spiritual pathway to a skilled artisan craft intended for courtly entertainment [84, 85]. **Lineage-Encoded Theory** explains how North Indian musicians inherited theory as an oral pedigree rather than through written texts [86, 87].\n* **Key Terms:** **Ustad-Sagird** describes the master-apprentice relationship equivalent to a craftsman and his pupil [88]. **Melakarta System** is the classic South Indian classification system of 72 parent scale types [89]. **Theka** is an independent rhythmic structural support adopted from Middle Eastern folk traditions [77, 90].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Contrasts the North Indian **Khay\u0101l** (collapsed composition, vehicle for tune) with the South Indian **Kriti** (devotional theme, clearly enunciated text) [91, 92].

He asserts that hereditary *khandani* musicians escaped colonial reconfigurations of their knowledge systems because they viewed their oral tradition as superior to Western notation and theory [108-110].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** **Ethnomusicological Discipleship** highlights the unique researcher-teacher relationship in India, where the scholar assumes a subordinate role as a ritual disciple (*shagird*) [107, 111]. **Public vs. Inner Space** (Partha Chatterjee) describes the colonial construct of keeping an \"inner\" cultural domain untouched by Western influence [108, 112].\n* **Key Terms:** **Khandani** refers to hereditary lineage musicians who are the primary foundational knowledge bearers of the oral tradition [108, 113]. **Ganda Bandhan** is a ritual ceremony in which a disciple is \"tied\" to a master [114]. **Public Secret** refers to the widely known but officially undisclosed identities of courtesan performers [115].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Covers the shift from classical Hindustani music to crossover and popular genres like **Qawwali**, **Ghazal**, and **Bhangra** [116, 117].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Focuses heavily on the **S\u0101ra\u0144g\u0131\u0304** and its historical stigma as an instrument of accompaniment for courtesans [113, 118].\n* **Musical Structure:** Reaffirms the importance of oral transmission and the deep exploration of a single **R\u0101ga** over several years [119, 120].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nNeuman provides personal ethnographic accounts of his 40-year apprenticeship with Ustad Sabri Khan [113, 121]. He also synthesizes census data and the history of music scholarship in the US and India [122, 123]."

She argues that the female dancer's body, though a commodity in a globalized economy, produces new ideologies of femininity that challenge the dichotomy between the \"chaste wife\" and the \"corrupt dancer\" [126-128].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** **Male Gaze** (Laura Mulvey) is analyzed and occasionally subverted in recent dance sequences where the female subject turns into the active observer [129, 130]. **Nationalist Ideals of Femininity** are contrasted with the \"Menaka\" and \"Sita\" archetypes\u2014the former being the dangerous temptress and the latter the chaste, obedient wife [131-133].\n* **Key Terms:** **Item Song** refers to a big-budget, spectacular dance sequence that functions as an advertisement for a film and its music [124, 125]. **Devadasi** refers to historical royal/temple dancers whose bodies became a site of colonial and nationalist contestation [134, 135]. **Laxman-Rekha** is a mythic patriarchal boundary that, when crossed, implies a penalty for women [133, 136].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Analyzes specific item songs such as \"Kajra Re\" (2005), \"Ek Do Teen\" (1988), and \"O Haseena Zulfon Wali\" (1966) [126, 137-139].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Mentions the **Ghungroo** (ankle bells) as a significant marker of the dancer's professional status [140].\n* **Musical Structure:** Discusses the blend of classical **Kathak** with folk styles and modern **Hip-Hop/Disco** influences [139, 141-143].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nNijhawan employs a combination of dance and film studies analysis, looking at bodily attributes, camera angles, and choreography [124, 130, 144].

The authors argue that the binary opposition between \"composition\" and \"improvisation\" is an over-simplified Western construction that fails to capture the \"composition-in-performance\" reality of these oral traditions [147-149].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** **Imitation\u2013Assimilation\u2013Innovation** (Paul Berliner) describes the process where students subliminally learn compositional principles by memorizing a canonic repertoire [150]. **Othering** refers to how Western scholars used the term \"improvisation\" to define non-Western musics as free/unstudied in contrast to the concrete Western \"work\" [147, 151].\n* **Key Terms:** **Radif** is the canonic repertoire of Iranian classical music, organized into 12 *dastgah* [147]. **Manodharma** is the South Indian term for \"forming in the imagination\" or improvisation [152]. **Bedaheh navazi** is the Iranian term for \"spontaneous playing\" [153].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Iranian classical music (Dastgah system) and North Indian R\u0101ga-based genres like **Khy\u00e5l** and **Dhrupad** [146, 152].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Mentions the **Santur** (hammered dulcimer), **T\u00e5r** (long-necked lute), and **Sarod** (fretless lute) [154, 155].\n* **Musical Structure:** Compares Iranian **Gusheh** (pieces within a dastgah) with Indian **\u00c5l\u00e5p**, **Jo\u00ae**, and **T\u00e5n** [147, 152, 154].

By blending traditional Punjabi folk elements with Anglo-American popular music, the genre creates a meaningful cultural space that navigates the complex relationships between the **homeland and the host country** [2, 3].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** **Pertinence** (as developed by Luis Prieto) is used to analyze how listeners assign specific musical traits to a cultural tradition through a process of recognition [4, 5]. The author also references **Bourdieu's \"symbolic power\"** to describe how social identity depends on the legitimization of various cultural influences [6, 7].\n* **Key Terms:** **Bolian** are the couplets that articulate the lyrics of traditional bhangra songs [8]. **Kaharva** is the specific trochaic eight-beat rhythmic pattern that has come to connote the genre in its British form [9]. **Saddh** is a brief introductory call that precedes the dance [8].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The article focuses on **British bhangra**, specifically pioneer works like Alaap's *Teri Chunni de Sitare* and modern hits like Punjabi MC\u2019s \"Mundian To Bach Ke\" [1, 10, 11].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** The **Dhol** (double-headed barrel drum) is the primary instrument, often accompanied by the **chimta** (iron bar with cymbals), **sap** (lattice clapper), **toombi/iktara** (one-stringed instrument), and **algoza** (double duct flute) [8]. In the UK, these are fused with **synthesizers**, Western drum kits, and **electric guitars** [10, 12, 13].\n* **Musical Structure:** Songs generally feature a **modal melody** in a high-pitched voice, structured with alternating chorus, verse, and instrumental sections [9]. The genre relies heavily on **sampling**, such as the superimposition of the bhangra eight-beat pattern over 4/4 Western pop meters [11].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author conducted **fieldwork between 2001 and 2003** in Britain (specifically Southall) and Punjab, utilizing **interviews with musicians and producers** (e.g., Channi Singh, Kuljit Bhamra), as well as **iconographic analysis** of album covers [4, 14, 15]."

The author argues that a complex system involving **mandals (festival organizations)** and political parties has transformed traditional festivals into a massive **\"festival industrial complex\"** that mediates labor, politics, and community identity [17-19].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author utilizes the concept of **Informal Authority/Sovereignty** (Thomas Blom Hansen) to describe how groups like the Shiv Sena and mandals operate outside state oversight to organize retributions and entitlements [20]. The **\"Music before Mosque\"** problem is used as a historical lens to understand contemporary sectarian soundscape tensions [21].\n* **Key Terms:** **Mandals** are local planning committees responsible for organizing massive festival events [22]. **Vargani** is the system of public donation (sometimes involving extortion) that funds mandal activities [23]. **Visarjan** is the ostentatious immersion ceremony for idols at the end of a festival [22]. **Hafta** refers to weekly bribe payments to corrupt officials to bypass noise curfews [24].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The focus is on **Hindu festival music**, including **dhol tasha pathaks** (percussion groups) and **banjo groups** that play instrumental arrangements of film and patriotic songs [25].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** **Dhol** and **tasha** drums are central to processions [25]. **Banjo groups** traditionally used the **bulbul tarang** (Indian banjo) but have largely replaced it with **electronic keyboards** accompanied by Western and Indian percussion [25].\n* **Musical Structure:** The music is characterized by its **high decibel levels** (often exceeding 100-120 dBA) and its function in creating an \"ephemeral discotheque\" in urban lanes [26, 27].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author employed **ethnographic and ethno-historical research**, including field interviews with banjo musicians, mandal officers, and anti-noise activists, as well as **sound level data** from NGOs and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board [17, 25, 28, 29]."

The author focuses on how women navigate and resist **patriarchal hegemonic structures** like the *gharana* system by asserting their own \"voices\" and stylistic innovations in semi-classical genres [31, 32].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author utilizes **Feminist Ethnography** and **Subject-Formation** to explore how gendered identity intersects with post-colonial subjectivity [33]. The distinction between **Gharana vs. Saili** (style) is used to critique the male-dominated lineage system and propose a more inclusive aesthetic paradigm [31, 34].\n* **Key Terms:** **Baiji/Tawa'if** are terms for hereditary professional female musicians and courtesans [30, 35]. **Nat utharna** (removing the nose ring) is a specific rite of passage for a girl entering womanhood in these communities [36]. **G.rhasta** refers to the identity of a \"householder,\" which some musicians adopt to escape the social stigma of their profession [37].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The article focuses on **semi-classical genres** such as **Thumri-dadra**, **Kajri**, **Chaiti**, **Holi**, and **Jhula** [38-40].

This shift prioritized literate middle-class authority over the oral traditions of the past [45, 47].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author frames the transition as a **Democratization of Indian Music** that simultaneously acted as a **purification project** to distance music from courtesan culture and \"illiterate\" artists [46-48].\n* **Key Terms:** **Sargam** refers to the solf\u00e8ge syllables (Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni) used to designate relative pitch [49, 50]. **Bandish** is the term for a song composition that is \"bound\" in lyrics and melody [51]. **Sam** is the strong first beat of a rhythmic cycle [52].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The focus is exclusively on **Khyal**, the principal genre of contemporary North Indian classical vocal music [53].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** The **Tabla** provides the steady framework for performance timing, while bowed instruments are analyzed through the lens of fingering and bowing notation [54, 55].\n* **Musical Structure:** Songs are structured into **Sthayi** and **Antara** sections [56].

While it acts as a liberal response to **Hindutva (Hindu nationalism)** by celebrating syncretism, it simultaneously trivializes actual Muslim culture and marginalizes traditional hereditary performers who cannot adapt to the new elite market [61-64].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author examines the movement through the lens of **Communal Harmony vs. Fundamentalism** [62, 65]. He discusses **Sufism as an Ideology** rather than just a faith, particularly its role as a \"soft Islam\" for the cosmopolitan elite [62, 66].\n* **Key Terms:** **Dargah** is a saint\u2019s shrine where traditional music is performed [67]. **Qawwals** are the specific group of singers who perform *qawwali* [68]. **Hindutva** refers to the militant socio-political movement championing Hindu pride [61, 69].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Styles include **Traditional Qawwali**, **Punjabi Sufiana Kalam**, **Sufi Rock**, and idiosyncratic new forms like \"Sufi classical\" or \"Sufi Kathak\" [59, 70-72].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Traditional setups include the **Harmonium** and hand-clapping; modern versions incorporate **sitar**, **sarod**, and electronic \"disco\" remixed tracks [67, 73-75].\n* **Musical Structure:** Traditional *qawwali* uses melodies based on **Hindustani rags**, while modern \"Sufi simplified\" pop emphasizes **slick ensemble orchestration** and auto-tune/remix aesthetics [71, 76, 77].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author utilized **field interviews (2006\u20132007)** with traditional shrine qawwals and bourgeois pop stars, combined with **textual and discographic analysis** of CDs and promotional music videos [78, 79]."

Focusing on the band **Fossils**, the author argues that the genre allows Bengali youth to express themes of **alienation, isolation, and self-loathing** that are ignored by the rigidly curated, elitist mainstream *bhadralok* culture [157-160].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author frames the genre through **Counterculture Theory** (Goffman) and **Subaltern Studies** (Spivak) to understand marginal voices [156, 161, 162]. **Foucauldian Governmentality** and the **Panopticon** are applied to analyze songs about isolation and social surveillance [161, 163, 164].\n* **Key Terms:** **Bhadralok** refers to the Bengali gentleman or social elite [159]. **Aekla ghor** (solitary room) is a recurring lyrical trope signifying loneliness [158]. **Kirtan** is a traditional religious musical event used as a point of comparison for the fan devotion seen at rock concerts [165].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The specific genre is **Bangla Rock**, with the band **Fossils** as the primary case study [157, 166].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** The music centers on the **electric guitar**, **bass guitar**, and **drums**, utilizing advanced studio production and sound design [162, 167, 168].\n* **Musical Structure:** Technical elements include **melody-based compositions** with a 4/4 beat, **grunge tones**, and a \"howl-like\" vocal delivery reflecting the pain of the lyrical subjects [162-164, 168].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nEvidence is drawn from a **pre-doctoral thesis and extensive fieldwork**, including over **300\u2013500 audience questionnaires**, interviews with event organizers, and analysis of **social media fan engagement** on YouTube and Facebook [165, 169, 170]."

This movement sought to naturalize caste inequalities and broker alliances between urban elites and the poor by framing Hindutva through familiar religious practices [1, 2]. The scope focuses on the urban Smarta Brahman bourgeoisie in Madras and their role as cultural mediators for the nation [3, 4].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author utilizes the Gramscian concept of hegemony to analyze how the movement reshaped \"common sense\" to secure the compliance of elites in constituting their nationalized identities [5, 6]. It also employs Louis Althusser\u2019s theory of interpellation to explain the production of power through the \"hailing\" of subjects [6]. The \"separate spheres\" ideology is used to explain the feminization of national tradition [7, 8].\n* **Key Terms:** *Jan Kalyan* is a Sanskritized expression translated as \"People's Welfare,\" referring to a social movement founded by the Sankaracharya of Kanchipuram [9]. *Matam* refers to a Hindu monastery and teaching center [9]. *Kaliccaram* is a Tamilized Sanskrit word for \"culture\" involving textually mediated artistic and scientific knowledge [10]. *Cumankali* refers to the paradigm of the auspicious married woman used as a national metaphor [11, 12].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The movement featured public performances of *bhajans* (devotional songs) in honor of the goddess Kamakshi [13]. It also promoted *tiruvilakku puja* (worship of the holy flame), a ritual genre associated with femininity and domesticity [14, 15].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** The oil lamp (*vilakku*) is analyzed as a ritual instrument used to embody the goddess Lakshmi [14, 16].\n* **Musical Structure:** The article notes the use of Sanskrit slogans and prayers repeated rhythmically as part of the movement's devotional gatherings [13, 17].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author gathered information through ethnographic fieldwork in Madras conducted in 1985 and 1987-88 [18]. Evidence includes field interviews with movement participants, participant observation of ritual events, and textual analysis of Jan Kalyan\u2019s press releases and its members' pledge [9, 13, 19]."

Higgins. \"From Prince to Populace: Patronage as a Determinant of Change in South Indian (Karnatak) Music.\" *Asian Music* 7, no. 2 (1976): 20-26.\n\n## Core Argument &amp; Scope\nHiggins argues that almost all recent changes in Karnatak music stem from the shift of patronage from royal courts to the general public during the first half of the 20th century [20]. This democratization altered the social, economic, and artistic life of the music, moving the musician's role from a religious devotee (*bhagavatar*) to a popular entertainer [20, 21].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The article relies on theories of social democratization and the idea that traditional culture content is inextricably wedded to its social organization basis [20]. It also discusses technological modernity through the impact of radio, discs, and microphones [22, 23].\n* **Key Terms:** *Bhagavatars* are traditional singers of religious music whose role was overshadowed by secular competition [21]. *Sabhas* are cultural organizations where individuals purchase annual subscriptions to attend public concerts [24]. *Rasika* is a term for a music-lover or connoisseur [24].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The focus is on Karnatak (South Indian classical) music [25]. Repertoire includes *ragas* like Todi and free-rhythmic improvisation [24].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Instruments discussed include the *mrdangam* (barrel drum), violin, *vina*, and flute [26, 27]. The *tavil* (loud barrel-shaped drum) is noted for its substitution in ensembles, which shifted musical emphasis from melodic suggestion to rhythmic insistence [27].\n* **Musical Structure:** The author discusses the \"time theory\" of *ragas*, noting that associations with specific times of day were lost when concerts were restricted to evenings [28]. Changes in acoustics are mentioned, specifically the lowering of tonic pitch for male vocalists due to the use of microphones [29].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe evidence is drawn from the analysis of presidential addresses and speeches by senior musicians like Musiri Subramania Aiyer and G.N. Balasubramaniam [25, 30]. The author also utilizes observations of the changing concert scene in Madras and professional activities of contemporary musicians [31, 32]."

Professional music-making is restricted to low or \"unclean\" castes, even though their music is indispensable for high-caste festivals and rituals [34].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The article employs a framework of social stratification, arguing that socially conditioned musical characteristics are more easily discerned in a caste-based society than in other high cultures [35].\n* **Key Terms:** *Gaine* is a professional bard caste exclusively engaged in music and begging [36]. *Guthi* refers to Newari social organizations that manage religious feasts and funerals [36, 37]. *Kusle* and *Damai* are musician-tailor castes that play shawms [34, 38].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The repertoire includes *Gaine jhyaure* songs, news-spreading ballads, and religious hymns performed at *Guthi* feasts [36, 37, 39].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Specific instruments analyzed include the *sarangi* (Gaine fiddle), *narsinga* (two-meter copper horn), *ponga* (short copper tuba), *dhime* (big drum), and various flutes (*bae*, *bansuri*) [36, 38, 40, 41]. The *ponga* is limited to a single tone and used for divine invocations [41].\n* **Musical Structure:** The article notes the use of folk *ragas* and *talas* in shawm ensembles and the \"Dyo Lahegu,\" an introductory piece played to appeal to deities [42, 43].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author conducted field observations and recording sessions in the Kathmandu Valley, specifically with the *Gaine* and *Jyapu* castes [36, 43, 44]. The evidence also includes comparative ethnomusicological analysis of instruments like the shawm across Eurasia [34]."

These \"song paths\" evoke sacred geography in South Asia, helping displaced groups achieve a sense of cultural belonging and diasporic emplacement [45, 47].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author utilizes theories of diasporic regathering (\"becoming one again\") and multi-local belonging to explain how a single tradition is maintained across different geographic contexts [48, 49]. The concept of \"sonic theology\" is used to highlight the importance of hearing the divine [50].\n* **Key Terms:** *Song path* refers to the conventionalized order of repertoire that also functions as a sounded pilgrimage [51, 52]. *Oduvar* is a professional temple singer and song custodian [53]. *Thevaram* are hymns devoted to Siva [54]. *Bhakti* refers to religious devotion [55].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The focus is on the *Thirumurai* verses, particularly *Thevaram*, *Thiruvasakam*, and *Panchapuranam* [51, 54].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Instruments used include the electronic *shruti* drone box, *mridangam* (barrel drum), and violin [54, 56].\n* **Musical Structure:** The article discusses the ancient Tamil *pannisai* music system and its contemporary adaptation into the Carnatic *raga* system [57, 58]. Specific forms like *Virutham* (nonmetrical semi-improvised recitation) and the use of *Adi talam* (8-beat cycle) are analyzed [59, 60].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author conducted ethnographic fieldwork in London, including participant observation at the London Sivan Temple during the Maha Sivarathri festival in 2016 [61, 62].

This was the result of the expansion of the gramophone trade and its convergence with print, radio, and loudspeakers, which created a new mass culture [67, 68].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The article uses \"technological modernity\" to describe how new media collapsed spatial and cultural distance [69, 70]. It also explores \"media ecology,\" specifically how print and radio supported the booming record industry [68, 71].\n* **Key Terms:** *Music boom* is defined as a historically unprecedented awakening of musical consciousness [66]. *Light music* (*mellicai*) refers to popular, non-specialist music intended for mass audiences [72]. *Devadasis* were a community of hereditary temple performers who became the first recording stars [73].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Repertoire includes Carnatic classical music, drama songs, \"folk songs\" (often parodies of labor songs), and *Vedikai Pattu* (comedy songs) [74-76].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Instruments mentioned include the *harmonium*, violin, *nadaswaram* (shawm), *thavil* (drum), *jalatharangam*, and various brass band instruments used in \"Indian orchestras\" [74, 77, 78].\n* **Musical Structure:** Orchestration is discussed as a significant innovation where Western symphonic sounds were recreated for Indian music [72, 78].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author conducted archival research on gramophone advertisements, catalogues, and songbooks [69, 79].

It explores the ambivalent relationship between aspiring singers and their idol, marked by both anxiety and devotion [82, 84].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author uses \"pirate modernity\" and the destabilizing nature of piracy to explain the expansion of the audio market [85]. It also utilizes Deleuze and Guattari\u2019s concept of \"assemblage\" to examine the connection between machines and human bodies [86]. The theory of \"embodied memory\" is used to explain the replication of voice [87, 88].\n* **Key Terms:** *Version recordings* are packaged commodities that reintroduce popular songs using voices of unknown singers [83, 85]. *Dubbing* refers to a system where scratch voices guide actors before being replaced by stars [89]. *Shraddhanjali* is a tribute album where Lata sang songs of deceased artists [90].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The focus is on Hindi film music (Bollywood) and devotional genres like *bhajans* [83, 91].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** The recording studio and tracking systems are analyzed as critical technologies for voice production [89, 92].\n* **Musical Structure:** Specific vocal techniques are analyzed, including *vibrato* (*kampan*), *murkis* (short ornaments), and singing at specific scales like *kali panch* or *safed saat* [93, 94].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nEvidence includes field interviews with playback singers like Anuradha Paudwal, Sadhana Sargam, and Mahalakshmi [93, 95-97].

He documents how these early observers recognized Indian music as a highly developed \"scientific\" art long before the era of laboratory analysis [102, 103].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The article discusses the \"Oriental Renaissance\" and the romantic admiration for India that influenced European music historians [104, 105].

While these institutions relied on the expertise of hereditary masters for their foundation, they ultimately replaced them with Hindu middle-class teachers to align music with a national identity constructed as inherently Hindu [122, 123].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author employs Althusser\u2019s theory of \"Ideological State Apparatuses\" (specifically the educational apparatus) to explain how submission to ruling ideology is reproduced [121, 123, 124]. The core concept is \"institutional communalism,\" defined as structured inequalities embedded in institutional procedures that systematically exclude Muslims [120, 125, 126].\n* **Key Terms:** *Gharana* refers to a hereditary musical lineage, with specific focus on the Lucknow gharana of sarod and sitar [121, 122]. *Taluqdar* is a term for the landed aristocrats who founded the Bhatkhande College [127, 128].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The focus is on Hindustani (North Indian classical) music, including *dhrupad* [129, 130].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** The *sarod* (invented by Niamatullah Khan) and *sitar* are central to the analysis of the Lucknow gharana [122, 131, 132]. *Tabla* and *sarangi* are also discussed in the context of hereditary teaching staff [130, 133].\n* **Musical Structure:** The institution focused on the \"scientific and systematic\" production of *ragas* through notation [134, 135].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author conducted archival research at the Uttar Pradesh State Archives and the Bhatkhande Music Institute [120, 136].

She contrasts the democratic \"raising voice\" (*\u0101w\u0101j ut.h\u0101une*) with the familial practice of \"calling\" or \"hailing\" (*bol\u0101une*), which constitutes the relationship between brothers and sisters [140, 141].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author uses Althusser\u2019s \"interpellation\" to show how discursive practices like *bol\u0101une* introduction a social reality [142, 143]. The framework of \"class distinction\" (Bourdieu) is applied to how middle-class urbanites relate to ancestral property versus education [144, 145].\n* **Key Terms:** *A. m\u015ba* is the ancestral joint family property passed down patrilineally [146, 147]. *M\u0101iti* refers to a married woman\u2019s natal home [148, 149]. *\u0100w\u0101j ut.h\u0101une* means \"raising voice,\" a sign of political agency [140, 150]. *Bol\u0101une* literally means \"to make someone else speak\" and refers to summoning or hailing a sister home [151, 152].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The article analyzes folk songs sung by Hindu women in North India/Nepal that portray the nostalgia for natal fields and the desire for brothers to fetch them home [153, 154].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Not applicable, though the \"voice\" is analyzed as a material signifier of agency [155].\n* **Musical Structure:** The article discusses the ritualized action of public mourning (*dhan sansar*) where women challenged tradition by performing funeral rites like men [156, 157].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author conducted ethnographic fieldwork in Kathmandu and Patan in 1998 and 2008 [146, 158].

It argues that political subjectivity is constituted not just through rational speech but through orchestrated sound, noise, and silence (*\u0101w\u0101j*), which create \"democratic soundscapes\" on the street and in the media [163-165].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author utilizes the \"biopolitics of silence\" and the \"acoustemic situation\" to describe the reflexive engagement with sound [166, 167].

It explores how the ideology of directness equates emotional transparency with democratic agency, contrasting this with traditional modes of indirection and irony [208-210].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author employs \"technologies of the self\" to describe behavioral changes meant to foster self-esteem and decision-making [211, 212]. It also critiques the \"anti-politics machine\" of development that depoliticizes systemic issues into personal problems [212, 213].\n* **Key Terms:** *Life skills* refers to a bundle of ten skills (e.g., effective communication, self-awareness) taught by UNICEF to empower youth [214, 215]. *Cetn\u0101 u*\n\u0002  *th\u0101une* means \"raising consciousness,\" a key objective of development projects [216]. *Sidha* refers to \"straight\" or direct talk [217].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Radio dramas on the program *S\u0101thi Sa \u0002nga Man K\u0101 Kura* (SSMK) are analyzed for their performative directness [218, 219].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** The recording whir and noise of tape machines are noted as elements that listeners use to detect \"liveness\" [220, 221].\n* **Musical Structure:** The prosodic features of radio voices\u2014such as lilt, tone, and tempo\u2014are analyzed as indices of \"authenticity\" [222, 223].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author conducted ethnographic research including interviews with SSMK hosts and analysis of over 200 listeners' letters and UNICEF \"life skills\" booklets [224-226]. The study also compares FM styles with the formal monotone of state Radio Nepal [210, 217]."

    "content": "# Colonialism, Philology, and Musical Ethnography in Nineteenth-Century India: The Case of S. W. Fallon\n**Citation:** Farrell, Gerry, and Neil Sorrell. \"Colonialism, Philology, and Musical Ethnography in Nineteenth-Century India: The Case of S. W. Fallon.\" *Music &amp; Letters* 88, no. 1 (2007): 107-120.\n\n## Core Argument &amp; Scope\nThe article re-evaluates the historical contributions of 19th-century philologist S.W. Fallon, arguing that his 1873 proposal for collecting Indian folksongs anticipated the aims and ethical positions of modern ethnomusicology [1, 2]. Despite Fallon's meticulous documentation of lyrics and social contexts, his methodology largely ignored musical structures, reflecting a widespread belief among colonial \"folklorists\" that the essence of a song resided in its words [3, 4].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The study utilizes post-colonial cultural critique to analyze Western views of the \"other\" and the re-evaluation of historical materials once deemed peripheral to ethnomusicological development [5, 6]. It also considers philology as a central tool of British Indian scholarship used to understand indigenous beliefs and customs [7, 8].\n* **Key Terms:** *Rekhti* or *zandini boli* is defined by Fallon as the \"language of women,\" which he viewed as the \"asylum of the true vernacular\" and the natural language of emotions [9, 10]. *Hindustani* refers to a language drawing heavily on both Urdu and Hindi that served as a developing lingua franca in North India [8].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The article discusses various vocal genres including *bhajan* (devotional hymns), *tappa* (Punjabi folksongs with elaborate ornamentation), and *khyal* (a dominant North Indian classical genre that also exists in a distinct folk context) [11]. Fallon\u2019s collection includes over 50 \"classes of songs\" such as nursery songs (*lorian*), seasonal songs (*savan*, *holi*), labor songs, and nuptial songs [12-15].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** The article mentions Gerry Farrell's own expertise as a *sitar* player but notes that Fallon's proposal does not analyze specific instruments [3, 16].\n* **Musical Structure:** The authors note that Fallon and other 19th-century collectors made no attempt to analyze musical structures or provide notations [3, 17]. The text describes how later scholars observed that folk music in the region often utilizes simple melodic structures with a range of three to seven notes [17].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nInformation was gathered through archival research in the Biographical Indexes of the Oriental and India Office at the British Library, as well as textual analysis of Fallon\u2019s 1873 proposal and his published dictionaries [1, 18, 19]."

He focuses on the 2006 protest song \"Nauchami Narayana,\" examining how it blended local devotional signs with political satire to galvanize regionalist feeling and contribute to the defeat of the regional government [21, 22].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The article employs subnational regionalism, conceptualizing it as a process intertwined with nationalism and the modern state [23]. It uses a Gramscian framework to analyze how the state manages dissent through a mixture of coercion and consent [24].\n* **Key Terms:** *J\u0101gar* refers to regional spirit possession ceremonies where healers \"awaken\" gods to speak and dance through human mediums [25]. *Dev Bh\u016bmi* (Land of the Gods) is the official slogan of the Uttarakhand Tourism Department used to emphasize the region's spiritual purity compared to the \"plains\" [26].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The primary focus is the protest song \"Nauchami Narayana,\" which appropriates the form of *j\u0101gar* rituals [21, 27]. Other genres mentioned include *b\u0101j\u016bband* (informal unaccompanied pastoral songs) and *poorakallai* (Keralite temple singing) [28, 29].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Instruments analyzed include the *daunr* (an hourglass-shaped drum struck by hand and stick), the *th\u0101l\u0131\u0304* (a circular metal plate played with sticks), the *h\u016brka* (a pressure drum), and the *\u015bankh* (conch shell) [29, 30].\n* **Musical Structure:** The song follows a tripartite structure modeled on *j\u0101gar* rituals: an invocation of multiple gods (*dh\u016bny\u0101l*), a narrative section to induce possession (*lehr\u0131\u0304*/*rauns\u0131\u0304*), and a concluding section where the gods dance (*mann\u0101n*) [27].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author utilized ethnographic fieldwork in Uttarakhand and Delhi, field interviews with recording artists and session musicians, and analysis of commercial VCD/cassette sales and censorship records [31-33]."

He argues that these musicians navigate the transition from informal gatherings to professional stages by balancing traditional devotional values with the entrepreneurial demands of neoliberal India [34, 36].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The study draws on Arjun Appadurai\u2019s theory of the \"capacity to aspire\" and subaltern studies to explain how marginalized groups reauthor their \"terms of recognition\" through performance [36, 37]. It also uses the concept of \"aesthetic theologies\" to describe the resonance between presentation modes and belief systems [35].\n* **Key Terms:** *Satsa\u1e45g* refers to an informal spiritual gathering or \"company of seekers\" for sharing spiritual ideas and songs [38]. *Nirgu\u1e47* defines a genre of devotional poetry attributed to *Sants* (poet-saints) that focuses on a formless or attributeless divinity [35]. *Ma\u1e47\u1e0dal\u012b* is a small circle or presentational troupe, distinct from the participatory *ma\u1e47\u1e0dal* [39].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The article focuses on *Malvi nirgu\u1e47 bhajans* (devotional songs) and their adaptation into Sufi *qawwali* styles [35, 40].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Instruments include the *tambura* (a rhythmic five-stringed lute), *kart\u0101l* (clappers), *ma\u00f1j\u012br\u0101* (finger cymbals), *harmonium*, and *\u1e0dholak* (barrel-shaped folk drum) [41, 42].\n* **Musical Structure:** The article notes the use of *\u1e6dhek\u0101* (a syncopated 14-beat rhythm related to *d\u012bpchand\u012b* t\u0101la) and syllabic melodic settings where melismas are restricted to end vowels [40, 43, 44].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author conducted field research in rural Malwa between 2014 and 2017, using participant-observation as a judge in a bhajan competition, as well as field interviews and recordings of various musical troupes [38, 45]."

Filmmakers increasingly view these traditional sequences as an index of cultural alterity that limits their prestige in the global cultural economy [47, 48].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The study analyzes media production through the lens of neoliberal economic ideals and Bourdieu\u2019s concepts of prestige and symbolic capital [46, 47]. It also explores \"audience imaginaries\"\u2014the discursive constructions filmmakers use to prefigure their viewers [49, 50].\n* **Key Terms:** *Playback singers* are off-screen vocalists who render songs that actors then lip-synch onscreen [51]. *Item numbers* are autonomous, lavishly produced song sequences featuring spectacular costumes and effects used primarily for marketing [52, 53].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The article discusses mainstream Hindi cinema and the use of background songs versus diegetic, lip-synched sequences [54, 55].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** While specific instruments are not detailed, the article notes the transition from traditional tunes to background orchestral scores and \"techno\" influences [56-58].\n* **Musical Structure:** The industry differentiates between \"musicals\" (films explicitly about performers) and standard films that use songs for narrative or promotional purposes [59].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author draws on 15 years of ethnographic research within the Hindi film industry, including interviews with directors, screenwriters, and actors, and textual analysis of trade journals and film reviews [60, 61]."

Despite academic and critical predictions of their demise, these elements continue to evolve in fascinating ways, such as through technical innovations in playback and choreography [63, 64].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The article applies choreomusicological theory to separate and deconstruct \"song\" and \"dance\" as distinct disciplinary categories [65, 66]. It also uses Foucault\u2019s notion of heterotopic spaces to analyze parallel sites of cultural meaning in Bollywood [67].\n* **Key Terms:** *Song picturization* refers to the visual realization and choreographed performance of a song within a film's scenic background [66, 68]. *Techno-qawwalis* describe a modern fusion of traditional qawwali functions with contemporary sexualized \"item number\" energy [58].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Discusses *qawwalis*, orchestral scores, techno-qawwalis, and end credits song sequences [58, 69, 70].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** The text mentions the orchestrations and brash instrumental combinations praised by critics like Satyajit Ray [71].\n* **Musical Structure:** The article highlights shifts in vocal timbre and song structure that accompanied the historical transition to playback technology in the 1930s [72].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe authors synthesize interdisciplinary scholarship from ethnomusicologists and dance scholars while providing critical analysis of cinematic trends and technological shifts across Bollywood history [64, 65, 72]."

She argues that while bhangra resists racial erasure, it often remains available for recuperation within patriarchal and nationalist constructions of identity [75, 76].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The article uses Judith Butler\u2019s concepts of performativity and parodic repetition to analyze how bhangra fabricates a shared ethnic identity [77, 78]. It also engages with Paul Gilroy\u2019s \"Black Atlantic\" to critique the elision of Asian cultural production in dominant diaspora models [79, 80].\n* **Key Terms:** *Bhangra* was originally a male form of rural Punjabi folk music and dance that became a transnational locus for British-Asian youth culture [81-83]. *Asianness* refers to a share identity constructed through music to cut across lines of religion, caste, and nationality [78].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The text identifies *ragga*, techno, rap, house, and dance-hall influences within modern bhangra [82, 84, 85].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Early practitioners altered the music using drum machines, synthesizers, and sampling technology [82, 86].\n* **Musical Structure:** Modern bhangra incorporates multilingual vocals (Punjabi, Jamaican patois, English) and techniques such as mixing, scratching, and raggamuffin beats [84, 85, 87].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author performs textual analysis of music videos and album covers (e.g., Bally Sagoo and Apache Indian) and conducts a critical dialogue with existing theoretical literature on diaspora and race [79, 85, 88]."

He argues that played-back music creates new, culture-specific meanings in local settings that may differ significantly from the intentions of the original recording artists [89, 91].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The article combines performance theory with popular music studies to analyze how sounds are \"entextualized\" and \"refunctioned\" [89, 92].

Drawing from ancient **Tantric** roots found in the *caryapadas*, the Bauls emphasize a sense of communal brotherhood and personal release over doctrinal precision [3-5]. The scope covers the historical evolution of Tantric influence in Bengal from the medieval *siddhacaryas* to modern nationalist appropriations of Baul identity by figures like Rabindranath Tagore [1, 3, 6].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n*   **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author employs **Syncretism** to explain the \"promiscuous mingling\" of Buddhist, Saivite Hindu, and Islamic concepts in Baul philosophy [4, 7]. It also discusses **Nationalism**, noting how Baul music was used to symbolize an \"indivisible Bengal\" during anti-colonial resistance to the 1905 partition [1, 2].\n*   **Key Terms:** **Tantra** is a set of religious precepts teaching release from phenomenal existence through the manipulation of one's physical and psychical constitution under a guru's guidance [3]. **Caryapada** are ancient spiritual poems considered the earliest record of the Bengali tongue [3]. **Neri** refers to a historical remnants of Buddhist orders who became a caste of \"shaven-heads\" and eventually merged into Vaisnava or Muslim Tantric sects [7].\n\n## Musical Focus\n*   **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The text discusses **Baul-gan** (Baul songs), which are often didactic oral poems signed with the poet's name, such as Lalon Fakir [8, 9]. Other genres mentioned include **Caryapada**, **Hindu Kirtan**, and **Nationalistic songs** composed by Tagore using Baul tunes [1, 4].\n*   **Organology (Instruments):** The **Ektara** is a one-stringed \"plucked drum\" used to produce a rhythmic drone [10, 11].

This shift replaces traditional aesthetic codes of **Rasa** with a \"remix\" aesthetic that produces commodified bodies shaped by media, technology, and consumption [18, 20, 21]. The scope investigates the **embodiment of subjectivity** among background dancers and the impact of economic globalization on Indian dance practices [18, 22].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n*   **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author uses **Phenomenology** to focus on the \"lived body\" and **Habitus** (from Bourdieu) to describe durable systems of bodily comportments that connect identity to place [23, 24]. It also integrates **Postcolonial Theory** to critique elite nationalist constructions of Indian dance [25, 26].\n*   **Key Terms:** **Remix** is the postmodern experience of consumption of pastiche where culture and commodity lines are blurred [21, 27]. **Item Numbers** are highly sexualized song-and-dance sequences often dissociated from the film plot to serve as high-value commodities [28, 29]. **Aspirational Images** create an impulse for personal transformation through brand consumption [30, 31].\n\n## Musical Focus\n*   **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The primary focus is **Bollywood film dance**, specifically **\"Item Numbers\"** like \"Dil Lagaa Na\" from *Dhoom 2* [20, 32, 33].

It argues that new practices like **literacy**, **silence**, and **fashion** are tactical responses to gendered and classed constraints [62, 63]. The scope examines shifting **structures of feeling** where affinal (marital) solidarity may replace natal family ties as women seek \"modern\" lives [62, 64, 65].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n*   **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author uses **Practice Theory** to analyze the tension between agency and structural determination [66]. It also employs Appadurai's **Mediascapes** and **Imagination** to describe how global media affects local identity [67-69].\n*   **Key Terms:** **Purdah** (pard\u0101) is a system of visual and social isolation for women meant to safeguard family honor [70, 71]. **Ijjat** refers to honor or prestige bound up with caste and gender [72, 73]. **Ch\u0101r\u0101** (birds) is a derogatory term for young women who appear \"out of control\" by engaging in excessive fashion or public visibility [74, 75].\n\n## Musical Focus\n*   **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Mentions **Hindi and Nepali film songs** used by male youth in \"eve teasing\" and **Maithil women's songs** and stories that elaborate on the trials of marital life [76-78].

It argues that Ladakhi music has evolved into a \"rich hybridity\" that situates the population within both a regional **mandala-like social structure** and a globalized modern media space [113-115]. The scope spans from the medieval Gesar epic to 21st-century Ladakhi pop music [112, 116].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n*   **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author employs **Hybridity** to describe the melding of Tibetan and Muslim musical traits [112, 117]. It also uses **Globalization theory** (Appadurai's scapes) to explain how Ladakhi youth maintain identity through online music videos [118, 119].\n*   **Key Terms:** **Mandala** is used as a symbolic diagram of the social and spiritual hierarchy of Ladakhi society [113, 120]. **Mi chos** (religion of men) refers to the body of lore, riddles, and legends passed on by storytellers and singers [121]. **Zhung lu** refers to congregational or traditional art songs [122, 123].\n\n## Musical Focus\n*   **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Genres include the **Gesar Epic** (gying glu), **Wedding songs** (bag-ston lu), **Congregational songs** (zhung lu), **Beer songs** (chang lu), and **Ladakhi Pop** [122, 124-127].\n*   **Organology (Instruments):** The **Surna** (double-reed oboe) and **Daman** (kettle drum) ensemble is a quintessential symbol of power [128].

It argues that the genre has moved from the **courtesan's salon** to the modern stage through a process of **sanitization**, where erotic lyrics are replaced with **devotional (Bhakti)** interpretations to suit middle-class respectability [140-142]. The scope focuses on the gendering of musical genres and the socio-historical shifts in patronage [138, 143].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n*   **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author uses **Feminist Theory** to critique the gendering of Thumri as \"out of control\" or \"feminine\" in contrast to the \"masculine\" Dhrupad [139, 144]. It also examines **Bourgeois Respectability** and the impact of the **Anti-Nautch Campaign** [140, 143, 145].\n*   **Key Terms:** **Tav\u0101yaf** refers to the professional songstress-courtesans who were the traditional performers of Thumri [140, 146]. **N\u0101yik\u0101** is the first-person female narrator who expresses desire for a lover or god [147, 148]. **M\u0101n** is feigned pride or arrogance used by the heroine as a strategic emotional reaction [149].\n\n## Musical Focus\n*   **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Primary focus is **Thumri**, specifically the older **Bandis** (dance-linked) and newer **Bol ban\u0101v** (emotion-focused) styles [140, 150]. Other genres mentioned include **Dhrupad**, **Khy\u0101l**, **Ghazal**, **Bhajan**, and **Hori** [146, 151-153].\n*   **Organology (Instruments):** Mentions the **S\u0101ran\u0307g\u0131\u0304** as the traditional accompaniment for vocal music and the **Harmonium** [154, 155].\n*   **Musical Structure:** Thumri is characterized by a **loose adherence to Raga**, the use of **mixed (mi\u015bra) ragas**, and an emphasis on the **meaning of lyrics** over pure musical display [146].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author utilizes **Fieldwork** and **Interviews** with both middle-class and hereditary musicians in India [156, 157]. Evidence includes **Literary analysis** of song texts, historical records of the **All India Radio** ban on \"scandalous\" performers, and **Narratological analysis** of the shifting mode of address in Thumri lyrics [140, 142, 145, 158]."

It highlights the gulf between **oral tradition** and printed notation, specifically critiquing how early 20th-century codification by Bhatkhande sanitized and distorted songs to fit nationalist agendas [161-163]. The scope covers the transcription of 430 songs from **commercial recordings** produced between 1903 and 1975 [164].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n*   **Theoretical Frameworks:** The study explores the tension between **Orality and Literacy**, noting that traditional music is imbibed as \"corporeal memories\" through imitation rather than reading [159, 165]. It also discusses **Nationalism**, where the middle class \"cleaned up\" music to disentangle it from courtesan culture [161].\n*   **Key Terms:** **Bandi\u015b** is a short song that serves as the fixed basis for melodic improvisation [166]. **Sargam** syllables (Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Dha Ni) are the Indian solfege system [159]. **Tonemes** are the broader units of musical cognition that include slides and touches [167].\n\n## Musical Focus\n*   **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The focus is on **Khy\u0101l** vocal music, but also includes **Thumri** [164, 168].

The scope covers the two decades after Independence, specifically focusing on Radio Ceylon and Vividh Bharati [188-190].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n*   **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author utilizes **Fandom** studies to analyze the \"continuum of practices\" among radio listeners [183]. It also employs the concept of **Cultural Intimacy** to explain the embarrassment some former listeners feel about their obsessive past request-writing [191, 192].\n*   **Key Terms:** **Pharmaish** is an Urdu word meaning request, demand, or order, which became a textualized media phenomenon through the radio [193-195]. **Listeners\u2019 Clubs** (shrota sanghs) were organized groups that sent bulk requests and published their own bulletins [196-198]. **Transistor** radios allowed for a more everyday, portable listening infrastructure [188, 199].\n\n## Musical Focus\n*   **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The central focus is the **Hindi film song**, used as a metonym for cinematic reception outside the theater [182, 183, 200].\n*   **Organology (Instruments):** Primary focus is on the **Radio apparatus** and the **Microphone** as mediators of the announcer's \"mystifying voice\" [185, 194, 201].\n*   **Musical Structure:** Discusses the **\"Aural Signature\"** of countdown-format programs like *Geet Mala* and the \"rhythm of expectations\" produced by serial broadcasting [189, 202, 203].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author reconstructs radio-listening practices through **Narrative accounts** from listeners and radio personnel, as well as **Archival sorting** of mail [182, 204, 205].

It utilizes the \"abrahmani\" school of thought, which targets the eradication of caste, class, and women\u2019s oppression [6]. It also draws on the \"Marxist-Phule-Ambedkarite\" methodology developed by Sharad Patil to historicize Indian society [5].\n* **Key Terms:** Shahir refers to a revolutionary songwriter and singer in the anti-caste movement [1, 7].

The \"Great/Little Tradition\" (Marga/Desi) dichotomy is used to show how Manganiyar music is theorized using classical frameworks while remaining rooted in folk practice [71-73].\n* **Key Terms:** Doha refers to poetic couplets sung at the beginning of a performance [74, 75]. Surs are Sindhi musical modes based on folktales and landscape descriptions [76, 77]. Kakadi is a musical game where ragas correspond to cardinal directions [78, 79]. Alamkhana was the royal \"Department of Music and Arts\" in the Jaisalmer court [80].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Mota git (large songs) are \"in raga,\" while Chhota git (small songs) are simple and functional [81, 82]. The sur Umar Marui is a central folktale shared with Sindh [83].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** The kamaicha and sarangi are bowed string instruments providing melodic accompaniment [82, 84, 85]. The dholak is a double-headed drum used for rhythm [82, 86].\n* **Musical Structure:** Manganiyar performance resembles the Hindustani khayal, beginning with a free-meter section similar to Alap, followed by a metered Git [82, 86-88].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author conducted research from 2005 to 2009 in Jaisalmer City and surrounding villages in India [89]. Evidence includes formal interviews and recordings with approximately 50 musicians, as well as textual analysis of Jaisalmer court documents [80, 89, 90]."

    "content": "# Evergreens to Remixes: Hindi Film Songs and India's Popular Music Heritage\n**Citation:** Beaster-Jones, Jayson. \"Evergreens to Remixes: Hindi Film Songs and India's Popular Music Heritage.\" *Ethnomusicology* 53, no. 3 (2009): 425-448.\n\n## Core Argument &amp; Scope\nThe article examines Hindi film songs as a dominant popular music genre that serves as India's \"popular music heritage\" [91, 92]. It analyzes the aesthetic-marketing category of \"evergreens\" and the rise of \"remixes,\" arguing that these categories mutually reinforce each other and reflect anxieties about neoliberal modernization [92-94]. The scope includes the history of broadcast media and the visual mediation of film songs [95, 96].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author uses the concept of \"Cosmopolitanism\" to describe how music directors oriented themselves toward both local and transnational musical fashions [97]. It discusses \"Cultural Memory\" as something that can be commodified by labels and DJs [95, 98].\n* **Key Terms:** Evergreen refers to old film songs (purane filmi git) idealized for their melodic dominance and poetic depth [99, 100]. Remix is a genre that transforms old film songs into contemporary dance music with heavy drum tracks [101, 102]. Item number refers to a song-dance sequence performed by a starlet that is unrelated to the film's main narrative [103, 104].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Key genres include Filmi git, Indipop, and Dub (which influenced remix practices) [96, 105-107].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Early films used large orchestras; contemporary styles utilize synthesizers, electric guitars, and electronic drum machines [108-110].\n* **Musical Structure:** Songs generally follow a refrain-verse-refrain structure [109]. Film music borrows from the Indian classical raga and tala systems [97].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author conducted ethnographic research on music markets in Bhopal and Mumbai from 2003 to 2005 [111, 112]. Evidence includes interviews with retail store managers, music labels, and fans, alongside analysis of film soundtracks and promotional media [112-114]."

These traditions exist in an \"intermediate sphere\" between folk and classical realms and serve as important vernicular music cultures that have been historically overlooked [116, 117]. The scope covers Sikh gurb\u0101n\u012b sang\u0131\u0304t, Rajasthani Lang\u0101 and M\u0101\u1e45ga\u1e47iy\u0101r music, and Sindhi k\u0101f\u012b [116].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** It utilizes the \"Intermediate Sphere\" concept to describe idioms that have a degree of formal theory but lack the standardized canon of classical music [117]. It contrasts \"Great Traditions\" (pan-regional, elite) with \"Little Traditions\" (regional, vernacular) [115, 118].\n* **Key Terms:** Gurb\u0101n\u012b sang\u0131\u0304t is the devotional music promoted by Sikh gurus [119, 120]. Sur is the Sindhi term for melodic types or r\u0101gs [121]. Th\u0101\u1e6d is a descriptive concept for classifying modal scales in Hindustani music [122]. M\u0101nd is both a raga and a Rajasthani courtly genre [123].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Surs from Sh\u0101h Jo Ris\u0101lo, Sindhi k\u0101f\u012b, and gurb\u0101n\u012b shabads are primary focuses [120, 124, 125]. Specific r\u0101gs include \u0100s\u0101, Sora\u1e6dh, and M\u0101nd [123, 126, 127].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** The danb\u016bro is a five-stringed drone instrument used in Sindh [128]. The kam\u0101ich\u0101 and s\u0101rang\u012b are traditional fiddles used by M\u0101\u1e45ga\u1e47iy\u0101rs and Lang\u0101s [129].\n* **Musical Structure:** R\u0101gs are distinguished by ascending/descending scales and characteristic phrases used for improvisation [115]. Sindhi surs are categorized by poetic theme and associated melodic type [125].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe authors used a combination of field research in Sindh, Kachchh, and Rajasthan (2014-2018) and textual analysis of Sanskrit and Indo-Persian music treatises [121, 130, 131]. The evidence includes transcriptions of traditional shabads and surs [132, 133]."

It argues that the brass band serves as a functional \"medium\" for wedding processions, where the status of the patron is reflected through the size and volume of the band [136, 137]. The scope covers band organization, urban setting dynamics, and the historical roots of instrument enculturation [134, 138, 139].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** It uses \"Enculturation\" to explain how European instruments were adopted and transformed by indigenous musicians [140, 141]. It also applies the concept of \"Mass Media replacement\" to show how film music has overtaken folk music traditions in urban settings [142].\n* **Key Terms:** Bar\u0101t refers to the groom's wedding procession [134]. M\u0101lik or Seth refers to the band owner [143, 144]. Band-Master is a title for Class I musicians with expert proficiency [145]. Naubat refers to traditional martial ensembles of the Mughal era [146].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The repertoire is dominated by Hindi film music hits, with some folk songs (Gujerati, Punjabi, Marwari) and Western pop hits like \"Tequila\" [147, 148].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Instrumentation includes Albert system clarinets, trumpets, baritone horns, sousaphones, snare, tenor, and bass drums [149]. Recently, battery-driven sound systems with electronic keyboards (\"Casios\") have been added [149].\n* **Musical Structure:** Heterophony prevails over harmony [150]. Arrangements follow a \"soli-tutti\" or solo-chorus pattern [151].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author conducted field research in India from October 1988 to June 1989 [134, 152]. Evidence consists of observation of numerous bar\u0101ts, interviews with band m\u0101liks across various cities (Calcutta, Hyderabad, Varanasi), and historical analysis of colonial military music influences [153-156]."

    "content": "# Making a Woman From a Tawaif - Courtesans as Heroes in Hindi Cinema\n**Citation:** Booth, Gregory D. \"Making a Woman From a Tawaif - Courtesans as Heroes in Hindi Cinema.\" *New Zealand Journal of Asian Studies* 9, no. 2 (2007): 1-26.\n\n## Core Argument &amp; Scope\nThe article argues that cinematic tawaifs (courtesans) represent a distinct gender identity in Hindi films, acting as heroic figures who undertake quests for respectability and domesticity [157-159]. It explores the \"woman-tawaif\" transformation and argues that tawaif narratives are structured like male-centered heroic stories of action rather than female-centered sacrificial epics [157, 160]. The scope spans films from the 1930s to the early 2000s [161, 162].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author utilizes feminist film theory, specifically Mulvey\u2019s \"male gaze\" and \"to-be-looked-at-ness\" [163, 164]. It applies Judith Butler\u2019s concept of gender as a \"cultural fiction\" performed through acts [165, 166]. It also uses A.K. Ramanujan\u2019s narrative structuralist view that \"gender is genre\" [167].\n* **Key Terms:** Tawaif is defined as a performing artist conflated with a prostitute [168]. Devi refers to a respectable heroine, often associated with family roles [168-170]. Mujra is the performance gathering where the tawaif dances for male patrons [171, 172]. Kotha is the salon where tawaifs reside and perform [171, 173].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The focus is on mujra music and dance scenes in films [171, 174].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Tabla, sarangi, and harmonium are identified as the instruments used to accompany tawaif performances [175]. Ankle-bells are noted as a sonic identifier for tawaifs [176].\n* **Musical Structure:** Musical scenes are described as structures that organize the story and plot rather than mere interruptions [177]. Despairing \"final dances\" often mirror flirtatious \"introductory dances\" [178, 179].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author performed textual analysis of approximately twenty-four Hindi films where tawaifs occupy principal roles, including *Pakeezah*, *Tawaif*, and *Devdas* [180-182]. Evidence is drawn from film dialogue, song lyrics, and visual choreography [183-185]."

It argues that these economic changes forced the industry to revise its understanding of intellectual property, leading to the 2012 \"Bollywood\" amendments to the Copyright Act [186, 188]. The scope covers the era from the 1957 Act to 2012 [187, 189].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author analyzes the \"Globalization of Capital\" and how it independent of real regional wealth [190]. It discusses the legal concept of \"work-for-hire,\" where producers own the rights to works created by composers [188, 191].\n* **Key Terms:** License raj refers to the pre-1980s era of extreme economic isolation and regulation in India [192, 193]. Version songs are re-recordings of hit film songs that were legally permitted by statutory licensing [194-196]. Royalties are payments made to rights owners for the utilization of musical works [188]. IPRS refers to the Indian Performing Rights Society [197, 198].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** The focus is almost exclusively on Hindi film songs and their subsequent \"versions\" and \"remixes\" [187, 194].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Not the focus, but the transition from shellac/vinyl to magnetic tape and mp3 formats is central to the economic argument [193, 199, 200].\n* **Musical Structure:** The article identifies a unique Indian understanding of popular song where the song\u2019s identity includes a specific original voice (the playback singer) [195, 201].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe research is based on archival research of press reports and trade publications like *Screen* [202, 203]. The author also conducted ethnographic interviews with industry pioneers, lawyers, and A&amp;R heads (e.g., from Saregama, Universal, and Sony) [193, 200, 203, 204]."

By analyzing the worldviews of travellers like Bernier and Fryer, the author suggests we can reconstruct Mughal music history, particularly regarding ceremonial bands and women musicians [207-209]. The scope covers the reigns of Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb [207].\n\n## Key Concepts &amp; Social Theory\n* **Theoretical Frameworks:** The author uses \"Orientalism\" to explain how Europeans sexualized and \"othered\" Indian culture to maintain control [210]. It contrasts the \"traditional Christian\" worldview (using the Bible to classify diversity) with the \"scientific rationalism\" of the Enlightenment (using objective but distant language) [211-214].\n* **Key Terms:** Naubat is the ceremonial and military band serving as a symbol of Mughal power [215]. Zanana refers to the women\u2019s quarters [216, 217]. Kanchani refers to public dancing girls, often conflated with prostitutes by Europeans [218-220]. Domni refers to female musicians who performed inside the female quarters [217, 219]. Diapason is a 17th-century term for a drone instrument [221].\n\n## Musical Focus\n* **Genres &amp; Repertoire:** Mughal ceremonial music (naubat), music of the zanana, and Islamic festivals like the end of Ramazan [208, 215, 216].\n* **Organology (Instruments):** Detailed mentions include the Karna (brass trumpet), Naqqara (kettle-drums), Pakhawaj (barrel-drum), and the Bin (Vina) [222-225].\n* **Musical Structure:** The article identifies Peter Mundy\u2019s 1632 account as one of the earliest written pieces of evidence for the use of the drone in Indian music [221].\n\n## Methodology &amp; Evidence\nThe author conducted a comparative textual analysis of 17th-century European travel journals and Indo-Persian chronicles [226-228]. Evidence includes travellers' sketches, eyewitness accounts of banquets, and official diplomatic correspondence [215, 221, 222, 229, 230]."
